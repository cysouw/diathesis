# A survey of German diatheses

Michael Cysouw <cysouw@mac.com>

This is a developing manuscript of a book about German diatheses. The current status is very rough, and consists of many notes to be developed further. Chapter 1-6 are already in useable shape.

This (large) scientific book is completely written in Pandoc Markdown, see the `default.yaml` and `metadata.yaml` files for the setup. Most importantly, it uses the filter [`pandoc-ling`](https://github.com/cysouw/pandoc-ling) for the processing of linguistic examples. In this way, the source of the manuscript is easy to read and type (see the files in `/text`) and can be transformed in many output formats with reasonable accuracy.

The easiest way to read the current version is by using the latest HTML output, which can be directly accessed [here](https://rawgit.com/cysouw/diathesis/master/cysouwDiathesisManuscript.html).
