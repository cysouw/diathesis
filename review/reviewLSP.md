# Review of Michael Cysouw: Encyclopedia of German Diatheses

I think this is a very inspiring book which brings a whole lot of observations together. The book should – in my view – definitely be published. A number of revisions – especially concerning the language data – are needed. Quite a number of examples are either ungrammatical or all right although the author claims differently. I recommend using attested examples rather than constructed ones and to check the acceptability of some examples with native speakers. This might affect the entire analysis presented in the volume.

> Examples have been checked and corrected. However, a deep investigation of all judgements is beyond the present scope. Any specific suggestions for revision in this review have been taken into account. 

Although the volume is focused on the morphosyntactic realization of arguments, it might be worth taking semantics more into account. This cannot be done systematically, I admit, but it seems that a number of generalizations/explanations are possible, if on relies on semantics. 

> I completely agree, and I make various suggestions as to possible semantic generalizations. However, as said, that full discussion is far beyond the current scope, and I am happy to leave great generalizations for others to publish!

A major issue concerns the use of the notion ‘light verb’ which I think is totally unjustified in very many cases. The author should be more careful in especially using this term but also in using other terms like for example ‘affectedness’. A number of general issues – some concerning the analysis, some concerning the form – are listed below.

> After thorough consideration (more below) I still think that the term 'light verb' is the least problematic of all alternatives. There is indeed always a problem when using terms in slightly novel ways, but this term is the least confusing, compared to all alternatives (as listed in Section 1.3.1). 

My general recommendation is that the book should be published after revision as it is a very interesting collection of different argument realization patterns! It is an inspiring book which I enjoyed to read.

# General comments

1. General impression

There are some serious problems with a number of examples. As a native speaker, I disagree with many sentence judgements. There as examples which I consider as ungrammatical and examples which are said to be ungrammatical but which are not (at least to my intuition). I recommend to rely on attested examples as much as possible and to refrain from constructing examples. I provide a detailed listing of problematic examples below. Reconsidering these examples might affect the analysis here and there.

> Thank you for all detailed input! I have gone through the examples and considered your input. The examples have also be checked by another German native speaker. In general, I agree that constructed examples are not ideal, but they mostly have the function to quickly identify what I have in mind. A full corpus-based investigation of all the hundreds of constuctions summarised in this book is a big desideratum!

2. References

I wonder why there are so few references in the body of the text. It is obvious that the author is familiar with the relevant research literature but he could cite it more often in the body of the text. It would be interesting for the reader to gain an overview on the relevant literature. Especially in chapter 7.1, I wondered why no references are included. I recommend taking the literature into account and providing the required references.

> Thank you for the additional references! And indeed, there is surely much more that could be included. However, my goal is not to provide a complete survey of everything that has every been said, but provide a survey, a starting point, for further study. The more than 150 references are indeed just a start, and I plan to revise and expand this in future editions of this book. By getting a first version out into the world I hope to have a point of reference for more discussion.

> Specifically as to 7.1: this is a difficult point, as there is an enormous literature about reflexives, which mostly deals with completely different topics. The seminal work of Kunze (1997) as cited seems an appropriate reference in this context.

Please check the reference section for correct spelling, especially the use of capital letters with German words.

> done, though there were only very few issues with capitalization.

3. Light verbs

The notion ‘light verb’ is used prominently in this volume. The term is used in a special way and the author should explain his conception of the term. How does the term ‘light verb’ – as used in the volume – relate to Jespersen’s (1942) original notion of the term? How does the term ‘light verb’ relate to the German notion ‘Funktionsverb’? I would like the author to be more precise with respect to his use of the notion of a ‘light verb’.
On page 39 (for example), it is claimed that hören, fühlen und spüren can also be used as light verbs. This is the first time I have ever seen someone making such a claim. It requires better support as it somehow contradicts the mainstream’s view on light verbs.
Why is the term ‘light verb’ rather than ‘auxiliary’ used?
On page 390, Funktionsverbgefüge are briefly mentioned. It is said that (this specific type of) Funktionsverbgefüge are not included in the volume. But the examples contain lots and lots of Funktionsverbgefüge.

> The term 'light verb' is explicitly introduced and discussed at the start of the book (Section 1.3.1, see http://cysouw.github.io/diathesis/fulltext.html#1.19). I don't think that going back all the way to Jespersen will shed new light on this term. In general, the term 'light verb' is used widely in the description of the world's languages with widely differing interpretations. However, I still think that it is fitting in the current context. There are many other terms used in the German grammatical tradtion (see the linked section for a survey), but they all have a rather different gist as what I have in mind here. So I use a term that has no tradition in German (different from the reviewer, I do not think that there is a 'mainstream' view on light verbs in German), but is still compatible with what in general a 'light verb' is supposed to mean, viz. the functional part of a complex predicate in a monoclausal construction, often grammaticalised with a bleached semantic content. 

> Specifically: 'Auxiliary' (Hilfverb) is not suitable, because it has a very strong interpretation in the German tradition for *sein/haben/werden*. Further, the note on p.390 is about *präpositional angeschlossene Funktionsverben* as used in the Duden grammer, which is something completely different from the constructions discussed in this book. *Funktionsverbgefüge* seems to be used mostly in that sense (e.g. https://grammis.ids-mannheim.de/terminologie/85). So that term is explicitly not what I have in mind when I used 'light verb'. I realise that the English term 'light verb' is used as a translation of the German *Funktionsverbgefüge* in Fleischhauer (2021; 2022), and this double usage is unfortunate. However, in my opinion it is not problematic, as we could easily be more specific for the two different uses, e.g. my usage could be 'light verbs wtih a verbal main predicate', while in a *Funktionsverbgefüge* it could be 'light verbs with a nominal main predicate'. I have added a few lines explaining this in the book.

> The claim that *hören/fühlen* etc. are also light verbs (in my definition) is indeed unusual, but it seems only logical to include them here, as the ACI-constructions behave completely parallel to all the other constructions dicussed. In general, this is a problem of terminology, and I think that 'light verb' is the least confusing option.

4. Coherence

The notion ‘coherence’ is a central term in the volume. I wonder whether this is a good choice of terminology as the term is also used in different senses in linguistics. It might be worth demarcating the use of ‘coherence’ in the current volume from the notion of ‘coherence’ as used in others work.

> The Term *Kohärenz*/coherence is widely used in the syntactic literature on German. I have added a few lines explaining the possible confusion in 1.3.1.

5. Language of examples (minor issue)

As a native speaker of German, I am able to understood every example but non-native speakers muss a lot without a translation of the examples. If this would be a book about a language I do not speak, I am not sure whether I would finish the book. It would be quite a lot of work translating all examples but it could be a compromise translating the numbered examples and just leaving the ‘further examples’ without translation.

> As noted in the preface I have also considered this, but currently I have decided agains it. Basically, this book is written for readers that both have some basic knowledge of German and English. That is also one of the reasons to use many constructed examples, because they are 'easier' to interpret. I do not think that there is anything to gain from adding interlinear glossing to the more than 1000 numbered examples sentences.

6. Mesoroles & Macroroles

‘[...] a ‘German Patiens’ might be defined as those lexical roles that are changed from accusative to nominative in the warden passive’. I know that this is just an example but – in my view – it does not work. With this test the second arguments of verbs like schlagen, sehen, hören, zerstören, erschrecken, etc. would be a ‘patiens’. The second arguments play entirely different roles in the events denoted by the verb and should, in my view, not lumped together in a single role. But is this really what is intended? If not, be more precise in explaining how, for example, the second argument of erschrecken can be distinguished from the second argument of zerstören.

> The problem I address is a different one: the notion 'patiens' is ill-defined in the literature. Mostly it is only very vaguely or implicitly defined. So, I personally simply do not know (technically) what a patiens is supposed to be. I do of course have a clear intuition, but that is not enough. So, my proposal (and indeed, this is not worked out at all here) is to reverse the situation: set a clear definition and adapt ones intuition to this definition. Actually, what I do here is just to define a grammatical category "X" and I need a name for this category. Because there is a strong overlap with intuitions about the term "patiens" this can be used as a name for "X". I have tried to make this clearer in the text.

The notion ‘macrorole’ is used differently from, for example, Van Valin (2005). Macroroles are usually conceived as abstractions over semantic/thematic roles and not as subsuming syntactic functions like ‘subject’ and ‘object’.

> I think my definition is completely in line with Van Valin's approach. The misunderstanding seems to lie in my usage of the terms 'subject' and 'object', which I use in a language-specific meaning, and not as abstract grammatical roles. I have tried to be more explicit in the text.

7. Order of diatheses

It is claimed that ‘the order of diatheses in a stack is of crucial importance’ (p. 29). The examples in (2.31) suggest that ‘modal’ precedes ‘perfect’, is this right? What motivates this order? Does it follow from the data? I wonder how one can derive at such an order based on the data under discussion.

> yes, this is basic syntactic analysis, which I do not want to expand in this book. Basically, the question of order-of-application is one of scope and can be identified syntactically by the order of the verbal elements in the construction. Also semantically it is clear that the order of application of constructions is crucial to the meaning of the end result.

8. Italics

The use of italics is not entirely consistent. Sometimes one finds ‘bleiben+zu+Infinitiv’ and sometimes terms for categories use not written in italics, e.g., ‘bleiben+zu+Infinitiv’. This should be made consistently.

> I have searched extensively for this to be consistent, but I have not been able to find instances. So I hope that I have not misunderstood this comment.

9. Epitheses

One productive pattern is missing ‘stehen davor zu + Infinitive’, e.g., ‘Er steht davor das Turnier zum ersten Mal zu gewinnen’ (termed ‘prospective’ in Fleischhauer under review). This is also a coherent construction and attested with several hundred different infinitives.

> Actually, this is a highly interesting construction, but it does not fall under the definitions as used in my work. *stehen* as discussed by Fleischhauer takes a governed preposition *vor*. The criterion for 'governed preposition' that I use is whether the preposition can also be used with a *da+vor* with a subordinate construction. Note specifically that it is not possible to have a construction *stehen vor + zu-Infinitiv* (without 'da'). There is an interested detail, that I do not delve into, what kind of of subordinate constructions are possible. Most the *da-* constructions allow for finite complement clauses (*dass ...*), while *stehen vor* only allows a non-finite subordinate construction.

Most the *da-* constructions allow for finite complement clauses (*dass ...*), while *stehen vor* only allows a non-finite subordinate construction.

10.  Affectedness & other categories

The notion ‘Affectedness’ is used differently by different authors. How is the term used in the current volume? I am not sure why, for example, ‘selbstbezogener Reflexiv’ (p. 92) and ‘Reziprok’ (p. 93) is subsumed under the notion of ‘affectedness’. The notion ‘affectedness’ needs a precise explication in the book.
I wonder in how far the examples in 4.38 (p. 93) display a (slight) difference in affectedness of the subject-referent. Is this mere intuition or supported by linguistic test criteria?

> The term 'affectedness' in chapter 4 was indeed unfortunate. I have changed it to the more non-commital 'diathetical epethesis'. This is clearly not an ideal name, and I look forward to a better analysis of the phenomena discussed under this heading. Note that there are a few incidental uses of the word 'affectedness' still in the book, but in these cases the word is clearly used atheoretically.

Closely related is the discussion of the distinction between unmarked anticausatives and unmarked causatives (p. 110). There seems to be an intuitive decision for analyzing the examples in 5.33 as an instance of a causative alternation. One wonders whether this can be substantiated by linguistic test criteria. One could argue, for example, that a gebautes Haus always presupposes that someone has built the house. There is definitely some semantics literature dealing with this issue (one could start with Andrew Koontz-Garbooden’s work). Anyway, a decision to analyze the example in terms of this or that category should be supported by linguistics criteria and not mere intuition.

> This is indeed a difficult issue, and actually I have been changing my mind various times over the last few years while I was working on this book. I have added some more clarification about my thinking in the text, but this remains a dubious point. Please note that I do explicitly not want to base my decision on semantics, as laid out in 1.3.4.

11.  Section references

There are some wrong references to sections throughout the book. Instead of the section number, it is only reference to ‘Section X’, e.g., page 105 (last line), p. 107, p. 113, p. 158, p. 179, p. 184 (twice), p. 186 (twice), p. 188 (3x), p. 195.

> done. thanks.

12. Verb senses

Various sentence pairs contain verbs which superficially look similar but have different meanings, e.g. verfügen and halten on page 151. I am not sure whether one wants saying that the different interpretations are the result of an argument alternation. If yes, one needs saying something about the semantics of the alternation. If not, I wonder whether it makes sense to conceive such pairs as an instance of an alternation at all. In my view, we are dealing with two different lexical entries which have their own argument realization patterns. Thus, I wouldn’t relate such entries by an alternation.
This issue is briefly discussed on page 160 (why just there and not earlier?) without a clear result. I recommend discussing this issue already in chapter 1 and take a clear stance on the question whether clearly distinct lexemes are related in an alternation or not.

> It is discussed in Section 1.3.2 already, immediately at the start

> indeed: in the *Schule*-context *schreiben* becomes reversible. The example from the Galler Tagblatt is interesting. Sound rather innovative to me. However, I simply changed the example verb to *drucken*

- p. 60 First line after 3.6.7: translations of German verbs are missing

> These are light verbs, which I do not translate. Added 'light' to indicate this.

- p. 60 3.18b Why ‘?’ in the example? The sentence is also ok with a durch-PP: Er wirkt durch die Stille entspannt.

> For me the questionmark signals that there is something strange here that needs more attention. I think this status is exactly right. I agree that it is not obviously wrong, but somehow it feels strange, and I cannot completely express why. So, no change.

- p. 61 It is mentioned that the actor in a passive construction can be expressed by a von -or durch-PP but there exist various other means for realizing the actor, cf. the enormous literature on the German passive construction, e.g., Pape-Müller (1980).

> Thanks for the useful reference: indeed, there are more options. I have added a reference in the section on the passive in Chapter 10.

- p. 62 3.25b Not ‘?’ but ‘*’

> Acceptability seems to swing widely depending on the lexical verb. I added another example to make this point clearer.

- p. 62 ‘The original subject an optionally’: ‘can’ instead of ‘an’

> done

- p. 65 3.33b In this case, the infinitive is nominalized and you are dealing with a clear instance of a German Funktionsverbgefüge.

> I  completely agree that this construction is on the boundary to nominal constructions. This construction is from the last chapter of the book. Originally, I had planned to add more chapters on *Funktionsverbgefüge* with derived verbs. In the end I decided to stop with constructions that have infinitives. Maybe I'll add more chapters in the future. However, given my current delimitations, this construction is in, while others are not discussed. 

- p. 65 3.34c The preposition am is possible, cf. Er hat einen Tropfen am Mund hängen. So, the last sentence preceding the example is wrong. The reason that 3.34c does not allow am is that the contraction is not possible in case of feminine articles and an, also something like an’r Nase is ok in spoken German.

> My point is a different one: the *am* is not possible in front of the infinitive. I have rephrased the text to make this clearer.

- p. 65 ‘in this diathesis the original nominative es demoted’: is demoted

> done

- p. 66 It is claimed that begrünen is derived from the adjective grün but it is derived from the verb grünen which is derived from the adjective. (https://www.dwds.de/wb/gr%C3%BCnen) The same for verdunkeln which is derived from dunkeln und not from dunkel. (https://www.dwds.de/wb/dunkeln)

> I changed the examples to make the point less contentious, e.g. *ermatten* and *befähigen*. I also added a few lines about the verbal intermediate in the main section on this phenomenon, 8.6.2.

- p. 67 ‘Is is not in widespread use and sound like’: sounds like

> done

- p. 67 ‘The light verb status of geben is better exemplified together with verbs that take clausal complements’: Why?

> With clausal complements only the causative interpretation is possible, not the literal interpration. I have rephrased the text to make this clearer.

- p. 68 ‘The possibly leads’: This possibly leads

> done

- p. 68 3.44a Again a clear case of a German Funktionsverbgefüge. One might wonder whether the noun Kuss is a regular argument of geben or not. There is some debate concerning this question, for references see Fleischhauer (in press). You could also use küssen instead of Kuss geben, if you like avoiding Funktionsverbgefüge: Du küsst ihn; Ich sehe dich ihn küssen; Ich sehe, dass du ihn küsst.

> indeed, the example with *Kuss geben* is problematic here. Note that the verb *geben* is not crucial here. I have exchanged the example with something more concrete, viz. *Kuchen backen*.

- p. 68 3.45b Soundy old-fashioned.

> I don't think it is old-fashioned, but uncommen surely. Long discussion in the relevant section in Chapter 10. Basically, it gets much better in embedded position, e.g. "als man die Band schon fast eingeschlafen glaubt kommt der Song zurück und kann mich diesmal sogar richtig begeistern" (https://www.metal1.info/metal-reviews/code-nouveau-gloaming/)

- p. 69 3.11.2 Why are you proposing a further diathesis? The dative marking of the original subject is expected (have a look at the typological literature on causatives). The cause becomes the new subject and is realized in the nominative. If there is already a direct object, the original subject can only become either an indirect object or realized within a PP. 
What is the reason for analyzing this construction as a type of ‘passive’?

> See Section 11.2.5 for an extensive discussion of the need to differentiate this diathesis (link added in this section). Basically, there simply is a different role-remapping, so it will be differentiated here. As noted throughout, it is indeed very similar to another diathesis, viz. *Permissivkausativ*. Note that the proposed German Name is *Passivkausativ*, so it is a type of Kausuativ, namely one that in some sense is reminiscent of a passiv (as the nominative is demoted to a prepositional phrase).

- p. 70 ‘though in this instance the diathesis is induced by a adverbial’: induced by an adverbial

- p. 72 3.55a Sie wichen vor der Polizei.: odd; better: Sie wichen vor der Polizei zurück.

> seems to be attested, but might be old-fashioned, e.g. *Und er wich vor keiner Drohung, keiner Gewalt.* (DWDS: Die Zeit, 15.05.1981, Nr. 21). However, I changed the example to *entfliehen*.

- p. 73 There is some debate whether verbs like singen – which are usually conceived as ‘incremental theme verbs’ – entail the creation of something in their intransitive use (Ich singe → Ich singe etwas). It seems that these verbs are basically transitive which seems to be contrary to the position adopted in the book (?), cf. e.g., Mittwoch (1982).

> I changed the example to *laufen*, which is less problematic. I do not really see the relevance of Mittwoch (1982), as there seems to be simply a general statement that all labile verbs are basically transitive. I still think that there is a difference between transitives with an accusative drop and intransitive with an accusative addition. However, as I note, the difference is not very large.

- p. 74 3.65b The sentence is ok, no ‘?’ needed.
- p. 74 What is the difference between ‘optionaler Akkusativ’ and ‘Aktionsfokus’, this does not get clear to me.

> changed the example verb to *sehen* and added some explanation. The difference in not large. The point is that many transitive verbs (like *sehen*) can still be used intransitively in a sense of 'to be capable of seeing'. I have restricted my definitions to make the differentiation clearer.

- p. 79 3.78a The sentence is odd.

> Example changed.

- p. 79 3.79b The sentence is ok (in context), as already mentioned above.

> Example changed here as well.

- p. 79 Is it claimed that there cannot be resultatives with intransitive verbs? One somehow gets the impression by reading this section.

> no, there is no such implication. Also note that the term 'resultative' has multiple different meanings in grammatical theory. See fn. 6 in Chapter 2.

- p. 82 ‘is placed at the end in a subordinate situation’: not the situation is subordinated but the clause.
- p. 82 ‘has a specific set of verbs to which can’: ‘to which it can’
- p. 84 4.6b The sentence has a habitual rather than a progressive interpretation due to ‘dauernd’. You can drop ‘dauernd’ and the progressive reading obtains.
- p. 87 In the discussion of the absentiv, it is claimed that the subject is not present. ‘Subject’ is a grammatical term and there is definitely a subject in the sentence. What is meant is that the subject referent is not present. But not present where? In how far does ‘Ich bin beim Arbeiten’ mean that the subject referent of I is not present? For me, the sentence has a progressive interpretative. Wouldn’t be ‘Ich bin bei der Arbeit’ closer to what is usually called ‘absentiv’?
- p. 88 4.20b Here we have a Funkionsverbgefüge again.
- p. 88 Concerning 4.3.8., it is claimed that no symmetrical construction with gehen exists but we find other constructions like zum Stehen bringen.
- p. 89 4.25b The sentence is ungrammatical but it would be fine with gedenke rather than denke. 
- p. 89 4.26b (as well as the second sentence in a): I do not like the sentences. Are they attested?
- p. 91 Is the example in 4.32 really (not) coherent, one can say dass das Wetter drohnt schlecht zu werden; dass er das Licht auszuschalten droht. I am not sure whether the contrast - proposed by the author really exists. The same for 4.33 on page 92 dass er immer wieder das Licht auszuschalten verspricht. I would even prefer these structures in sentences like Dass er immer wieder das Licht auszuschalten verspricht und doch nicht tut, ärgert mich sehr.
- p. 96 ‘the possible connections attested between construction’: ‘constructions’
- p. 97 Concerning 5.2.2 I wonder whether ‘quantified’ is the right predicate. Laut, as in 5.3.c, is clearly not an instance of quantification. (Also 5.15 on page 104)
- p. 98 The lexicalized noun-verb combinations are compared with noun incorporation. The noun-verb form are, in various instances, not a morphological word which is clearly different from noun incorporation. E.g., Er stand die ganze Nacht über Wache. This extends to page 100, there ‘noun incorporation’ is listed as a category of attested verbs. It might be worth comparing it with pseudo-incorporation, see, for example, the introduction in Borik & Gehrke (2015).
- p. 98 5.7b I agree that a question with was is impossible (not ‘?’ but ‘*’) but you can ask Wie ist er gestorben? – Einen qualvollen Tod!
- p. 100 5.11c Um is a preposition is this case and requires an argument Ich ziehe den Zaun um das Feld. Otherwise you can say Ich ziehe um (nach Köln) and even Der Zoo zieht die Seelöwen um.
- p. 102 ‘The verbs listed here need a genitive Argument’: ‘argument’
- p. 110 ‘Ich bin weggetreten’: This also has the meaning ‘being unconscious’; this is the dominant interpretation for me
- p. 110 ‘Ich habe den Lärm der Stadt entflohen‘: I only accept sein; dialectal variation?
- p. 110 Concerning the ‘further examples’: What is the rationale behind the listing? Sometimes
the list includes the perfect of the transitive verb, sometimes not. 
- p. 111 ‘The Schreck benimmt ihm den Atem’: Without be-
- p. 111 5.3.7 Why are there no examples?
- p. 104 ‘Er hat zehn kilo zugenommen’: Kilo
- p. 104 For verbs like wiegen and kosten have a look at Gamerschlag (2014), there you find a useful discussion of the interpretation as well as argument realization of these verbs.
- p. 106 ‘Das kochen klappt noch nicht so gut.’: Kochen
- p. 107 5.5.4 Is this just an instance of ‘impersonal passive’? If yes, say so. If not, this would
also be interesting to know.
- p. 107 ‘Die Wunde hat geheilt’: Odd, I only accept sein
- p. 108 ‘Die Fähre hat abgestoßen’: That’s ungrammatical (at least for me). Due you have an attested example?
- p. 108 Besides ‘Die Bombe hat gezündet’ also ‘Die Bome ist gezündet’ is possible. Which is worth mentioning since you mention the variation between sein and haben regarding duschen in 5.26.
- p. 108 5.28c The second sentence is incomplete: Mein Sohn ist angehalten pünktlich zu sein; I think adding von mir is not acceptable. But this would be worth checking in a corpus as there might be sentences of this type in which adding a von-PP is acceptable.
- p. 111 5.6.3 Further verbs: sitzen – setzen, liegen legen
- p. 112 The examples in 5.37 and 5.38 illustrate different types of illustrations. Either you discuss this in more details or you should you list examples exemplifying the same type of alternation. The conative alternation in 5.37c is something different from the plain intransitive use of essen or backen in 5.37b and 5.38c.
- p. 113 5.42 The examples contain different uses of unterrichten, in b. and e. it means ‘teach’, in c. and d. it means ‘report, notify’ and in a. it can mean both. It might be worth distinguishing between the different uses to check systematically whether the alternations are dependent on the verb’s meaning (use).
- p. 114 5.43a The example is odd, at least for me.
- p. 114 In 5.7.4 it is stated that some verbs only allow inanimate subjects; one of the examples is sitzen. This is related to a specific interpretation of sitzen, right? Like in Die Jacke sitzt (mir) gut.
- p. 115 ‘this diathesis seem to be restricted’: seems
- p. 115 ‘Ich spreche dir den Dank aus’: either without den or something like den Dank aller
Kollegen
- p. 116 ‘The verb nahelegen is is’: delete one ‘is’ 
- p. 116 ‘to read aloud*: wrong symbol
- p. 116 ‘I h bezichtige dich nicht’: Only possible in a context like: ‘Du bezichtigst mich des Diebstahls. Nein, ich bezichtige dich nicht.‘ But even here, I think the genitive NP is highly missing.
- p. 117 ‘Er hat die 400 meter geschwommen.’: Meter
- p. 118 ‘er floh ihren Blick’: Er
- p. 118 5.51 Punctuation mark is missing
- p. 119 ‘Mir dampft der Tee’/‘Mir stinken die Socken’: Strange sentences; attested? Stinken with a dative subject does not mean ‘smell’ but (roughly) ‘dislike’.
- p. 119 ‘Mein Kopf schwindelt. Mir schwindelt der Kopf’: I think both sentenes are rather strange.
- p. 120 5.56 The contrast between b. and c. is due to the determiner: Ich koche deine Suppe für dich (deine Lieblingssuppe) and Ich koche die Suppe für dich (die, die du bestellt hast) are ok. The same for the examples in 5.58.
- p. 122 5.64a This rather is odd, therefore it would be worth citing an attested example. 
- p. 128 6.11c ‘ich bin getanzt‘: Ich
- p. 129 ‘The comitative interpretation’: the
- p. 129 6.13a/c Punctuation marks missing
- p. 129 6.16 What about sentences like Ich kämpfe mit dem Schwert; the PP cannot easily dropped
- p. 130 6.17 Is there something missing between b. and c.?
- p. 130 ‘paraphrased by um zu-Infitive phrase’: either ‘an um zu-Infitive phrase’ or ‘phrases’
- p. 130 6.18c I think bekomme is preferred over habe, if arbeiten is in the present tense.
- p. 130 6.21a Only a von-PP not a durch-PP is possible.
- p. 131 6.23b This only works with zerbrechen not with brechen. Or you add a result-XP Ich breche den Spiegel entzwei/kaputt/in Teile.
- p. 132 ‘Das Problem steht zur Diskussion’: zur Diskussion stehen is a Funktionsverbgefüge; similarly unter Zugzwang geraten in 6.26b
- p. 132 ‘Das Buch handelt über die Relativitätstheorie’: I prefer von
- p. 133 ‘Er hat viel Arbeit an das Haus gewandt’: Totally unacceptable
- p. 134 6.30 Verwarnung/verwarmen instead of Warnung/warnen would be more idiomatic. 
- p. 134 6.32b The sentence is acceptable in the right context, it means ‘Karl is cooperative’.
- p. 135 ‘Ich komme zu einem harmlosen Ergebnis. Gestern kam es zu einem Streit.’: The pair of examples contains different Funktionsvebrgefüge.
- p. 135 6.34a The example means ‘He is missing/longing for his money’ not ‘He is lacking money’.
- p. 136 6.35b Compare Mir ist kalt with Ich bin kalt; it is a well-known cross-linguistically that experiencer subjects are realized in the dative case.
- p. 138 6.39d Hände is not a real instrument but – following the analysis of Van Valin & Wilkins (1996) – an implement. It might be worth taking this into account as it explains the ungrammaticality of the example. See, also, Van Hooste (2018).
- p. 138 ‘who produces the source’: If ‘source’ is intended to be a grammatical term, you should rephrase is by ‘the referent of the source argument’ or something like this. Otherwise, I am not sure what this sentence is intended to mean. I also think that ‘produce’ is not appropriate (see comment above).
- p. 141 It is claimed that the ‘present tense’ is not possible for intransitive öffnen. If this is really what the author wants to say, it is wrong. Die Tür öffnet automatisch [...]. https://www.welt.de/wirtschaft/webwelt/article179800530/Smart-Locks-Diese-smarten-Schloesser-oeffnen-dieHaustuer-selbststaendig.html; 03.01.2022
- p. 141 6.50d The example is odd, but ‘Der Zoo öffnet’ is fine.
- p. 141 ‘Die Soldaten rücken in die Kaserne’: I think the right verb is einrücken not just rücken
- p. 141 ‘Das hohe Gehalt zieht ihn nach Australien. Er zieht nach Australien’: These are two different meanings of ziehen.
- p. 141 ‘Ich schwemme das Pferd im Fluß’: Totally ungrammatical
- p. 141 6.51 in dem Korb
- p. 142 ‘The generalization seem to be’: seems
- p. 143 6.57c dem Brief
- p. 144 ‘Der Knoten platzt’: This is an idiom, a better example would be ‘Der Ballon platzt’
- p. 145 **Examples**: Why ‘*’?
- p. 145 ‘The possessor of the prepositional phrase’: It is not the possessor of the phrase but of its referent.
- p. 147 For argument alternations concerning kratzen cf. Fleischhauer (2018). Also for beißen, zwicken (page 149, 163) and schlagen, treten (page 150).
- p. 148 In how far does affectedness play a role in the examples in 6.67a and c? What notion of ‘affectedness’ is used in this analysis?
- p. 148 ‘Ich küsse auf deine Wange’: Ich küsse dich auf deine Wange.   
- p. 148 ‘Ich treffe auf das Tor’: I prefer in rather than auf. I think the preposition has a spatial meaning and use can say something like Ich treffe ihn auf den Kopf or Ich treffe auf das Auto meaning ‘on top of the car’.
- p. 148 ‘Ich spreche Englisch. Ich spreche auf English’: This alternation shows contrast between having an abilitiy and doing something in a specific way. The first sentence means ‘I have the ability to speak English’ and the second one means ‘I am speaking in English’.
- p. 148 ‘The verbs hören and achten show considerable semantic shift in this alternation’: Be more precise, how are they shifting? As I mentioned above, the same is true of other verbs.
- p. 149 Further examples of 6.7.6.5: Does affectedness really play a role? Is it not the case that the subject referent plays a different role in the two sentences of each pair? The last sentence for example expresses a contrast for the subject being either the ‘Fahrer’ (first sentence) or just a ‘Mitfahrer’ (second sentence)?
- p. 150 6.70b I prefer the sentence without mit. 6.70c I prefer einander rather than miteinander. 
- p. 150 ‘Accusative objects that alternate with an von prepositional phrase’: a
- p. 151 ‘Ich nasche ein par Beeren’: paar
- p. 151 ‘Ich verfüge einen Einreisestopp. Ich verfüge über viel Geld’: Two entirely different senses. The first sentence means ‘to order something’, the second one means ‘to have something at one’s disposal’. The same is true of the pair ‘Ich halte dich. Ich halte zu dir’. I am not sure whether it makes sense comparing such sentence pairs. I do not think that the different interpretations are derived by the alternation but that each sense has its own argument realization pattern. Thus, in my view it does not make sense speaking of an alternation in such cases.
- p. 151 6.72c The sentence is ok, why ‘*’?
- p. 151 6.73a I think the PP is not optional but required in this example.
- p. 152 ‘Sie wichen vor der Polizei’: The sentence is ungrammatical without zurück.
- p. 153 ‘Ich zeige das Haus an den Käufer’: ungrammatical; the same with ‘Er entzieht das Sorgerecht von ihr‘.
- p. 154 ‘Ich zögere damit, Maßnahmen zu nehmen.’: Nehmen does not work here, use ergreifen instead.
- p. 155 ‘The genitive ditransitive in this group allow’: allows 
- p. 155 ‘Er beraubt dich von deinen Rechten’: ungrammatical
- p. 156 ‘Es kommt an auf die Eleganz. Mir kommt es an auf die Eleganz.’: In both sentences, an should go to the end of the sentence.
- p. 156 6.78c Start with a capital letter.
- p. 157 First example without punction mark.
- p. 157 ‘In such constructions are location seems obligatory’: the instead of are?
- p. 157 ‘like in (6.79), and example’: examples (?)
- p. 157 ‘or the Accusative’: accusative
- p. 157 ‘dass... Phrase’: phrase
- p. 158 ‘ich schwitze einen Fleck in meinen Hemd.’: mein Hemd
- p. 158 ‘Sie gräbt das Frühstück aus dem Rucksack’: graben is used metaphorically, why don’t you use an example like: ‘Sie gräbt die Kartoffeln aus dem Boden’?
- p. 159 6.83c Is this really an attested example? Even if, it is clearly idiomatic.
- p. 159 6.84d The sentence can also mean: ‘Ich befehlige die Armee, die an der Front ist‘ 
- p. 159 Last one of the further examples: Start with a capital letter
- p. 160 Punctuation mark missing after the second sentence.
- p. 160 ‘Maybe the als alternation’: What kind of alternation is meant?
- p. 161 6.86a Does not work for me, better ‘Ich breche das Brot’ but even this is somehow strange. I prefer a resultative-XP (Ich breche XY in zwei Teile) or the prefix zer(Ich zerbreche den Stein). Similarly for example g. (Durch das Zerbrechen des Steins...).
Although in the further examples (why does the brechen-example occur there again?).
- p. 161. brechen does not fit into the class of verbs listed under ‘attested examples’ as brechen is the only resultative verb (the other verbs are non-resultative).
- p. 161 6.86e/f einen Kristall
- p. 162d I think the example is ok. Attested: Ich gewinne dir den Hauptpreis. 5 https://www.wattpad.com/amp/1012317047; 06.01.2022
- p. 163 6.92a/b I think the examples are strange and I prefer the sentences without dative - pronouns.
- p. 163 ‘Er steht mir zur Seite. Er steht zu meiner Seite.’: Two distinct meanings; the first sentence either contains a Funktionsverbgefüge or an idiom (depending on the analysis).
- p. 163 ‘Ich falle vor deinen Füßen’: deine
- p. 164 ‘verbs are have an accusative arguments’: argument
- p. 164 Start the first of the further examples with a capital letter.
- p. 164 Although ‘Ich jage dir den Anwalt auf den Hals’ is acceptable, the sentence ‘Ich jage den Anwalt auf deinen Hals’ is not. The example is an idiom, I think.
- p. 165 ‘wegen seine Ehrlichkeit’: seiner
- p. 166 ‘Er gießt Wasser an die Blumen’: This example is somehow strange. Maybe you can use an attested sentence?
- p. 171 7.6b Why is the sentence marked as ungrammatical? The sentence is perfectly acceptable!
- p. 172 7.8b Punctuation mark is missing.
- p. 172 7.7b/7.8b In the right context, the sentences are all right.
- p. 173 7.12b The sentence is okay, e.g. ‘Ich habe dich hierher bemüht, weil...’
- p. 173 7.3.1 The combination of verand reflexive pronoun results in an erratic interpretation and is very productive in German (cf. Stiebels 1996). Further verbs: verwählen, verlaufen, verfahren, verschreiben, verrechnen, verlesen, versprechen + sich. Without sich a different interpretation result: sich verschreiben ‘write something wrong’ vs etwas verschreiben ‘prescribe’.
- p. 174 ‘Die neugeborenen Katzen behaaren sich allmählich’: This is totally out! 
- p. 175 ‘Die Krankheit äußert sich durch das Fieber’: More idiomatic without das.
- p. 176 7.21b I think the example is ok: Das erste Zahnrad hat sich mit dem zweiten verklemmt. Maybe you can find an attested example.
- p. 176 7.22b The reflexive is not required, cf. Heute treffe ich meine alten Lehrer. 
- p. 176 The reference to the section below 7.22 is wrong. Similarly on page 179.
- p. 177 7.24b I disagree; what about a sentence like Dieser Vorfall, den alle nur eine Einbildung gehalten haben, ereignete sich (aber) wirklich/tatsächlich.
- p. 177 ‘Europa bückt sich dem Willen der USA’: You cannot use bücken here, take beugen.
- p. 177 ‘In Scharen gesellt sies ich häufig dem Hausgeflügel zu. (DWDS)’: Usually, the source
is not mentioned directly following the example but in a footnote. Be consistent please. 
- p. 178 ‘Mit dieser Aufgabe tue ich mir schwer’: mich
- p. 178 ‘Er langte sich ein Glas’: Does not work for me.
- p. 178 7.27 Punctuation marks are missing.
- p. 180 7.32b mein
- p. 180 ‘Er hat sich bei/an ihm angebiedert’: an requires accusative, not dative
- p. 180 ‘Die Schülerin hat sich der Lehrerin eingeschmeichelt’: ungrammatical without bei
- p. 181 ‘Die Tochter bequemte sich ihres Wunsches’: Does not work, better Die Tochter
bequemte sich ihrem Wunsch zu entsprechen.
- p. 181 ‘Mit welchem Ziel hätten wir uns dazu erdreisten können’: better sollen dann können - p. 181 7.34 I find both examples unacceptable.
- p. 181f. 7.4.1 I do not think that the reflexive version entails a change of state (at least not in the mentioned example as you can say Er kniete sich stundenlang auf den Boden which is clearly an activity predicate and not an achievement/accomplishment predicate).
- p. 182 ‘Die Erde dreht’: Strange but better if you say: Die Erde dreht und dreht.
- p. 182 ‘Ich habe hingekniet’: Odd, Ich habe mich hingekniet.
- p. 182 7.38a Why ‚?‘, the sentence is totally acceptable.
- p. 183 ‘Ich entscheide für den Angriff’: Odd, entscheide mich is the only acceptable version - p. 183 ‘Ich erstaune mich über das viele Geld’: Odd, only without reflexive pronoun
- p. 183 7.43 sorgen and sich sorgen have different meanings
- p. 183 7.4.2 Have a look on Wiskandt (2021) for constraints on reflexive marking in
combination with psych predicates in German.
- p. 185 ‘Er hat alles erspart’: Odd
- p. 187 ‘also possible with “free” datives?’: Why ‘?’
- p. 187 Further examples below 7.54: Punctuations marks are missing
- p. 189 ‘Ich ordne die Pflanze einer Systematik unter’: I think einordnen (without unter) would be more idomatic. But you can use a different example: Ich ordne meine weiteren Pläne deinen Wünschen unter.
- p. 190 7.65b: Odd
- p. 191 Is the section on ‘Reciprocal alternations’ complete? I somehow have the feeling that something is missing here.
- p. 191 7.66 Start with capital letters, punctuation marks are missing.
- p. 192 7.4.18/7.4.19 Punctuation marks are missing in the examples.
- p. 192 7.4.20 Is this the final text? Somehow this seems to be incomplete.
- p. 193 Punctuation marks are (partially) missing in the further examples on the top of the page. 
- p. 193 7.69b The example is strange, I prefer Bei diesem Buch handelt es sich um ein Linguistikbuch. The example listet under ‘further examples’ is acceptable as well.
- p. 193 7.5.2 First sentence, repetition of an.
- p. 195 ‘Wir wollen das Problem nicht (noch mehr) komplizieren’: verkomplizieren (the same
for the second sentence)
- p. 195 ‘Ich bessere die Straße’: Here you need the verb ausbessern or verbessern might also work.
- p. 196 7.77b Ungrammatical
- p. 196 ‘Der Paragraph fügt sich dem Gesetz hinzu’: Strange, it somehow induced agentivity on
side of the Paragraph.
- p. 196 ‘Der Bauplan erklärt sich dem Benutzer’: Strange but it improves if you add ‘von ganz
alleine’.
- p. 197 ‘Ich nähre mich mit (von) Milch’: Here you need ernähren, also on page 199.
- p. 198 ‘Ich entsetze mich bei dem Anblick’: über instead of bei
- p. 198 ‘Ich habe mich erfreut an der Musik’: erfreut should go to the end.
- p. 199 ‘Das Alter beschwert mich’: Odd
- p. 199 ‘Ich unterhalte das Publikum. Das Publikum unterhält sich mit mir’: Two completely different verb meanings. The same for the two examples with drücken.
- p. 199 Check for missing punctuation marks.
- p. 199 ‘Ich werde erheitert durch die gute Nachricht’: erheitert should go to the end.
- p. 200 ‘Ich graue mich’: odd without vor-PP.
- p. 201 ‘verbs that hurt’: verbs cannot hurt, you probably mean the activity denoted by the verb. 
- p. 201 7.88c Why ‘*’? I think it is ok.
- p. 201 ‘Er verschläft sich’: Odd, but better if you say ‘Er verschläft sich um 10 Minuten’
- p. 201 7.89c das not den
- p. 202 7.90 Why not earlier?
- p. 203 7.95b Really? Is this attested?
- p. 204 ‘Ich wage mich an der Aufgabe’: die
- p. 204 ‘Der Schauspieler versucht sich in der neuen Rolle’: Punctuation mark missing
- p. 204 ‘Ich behaupte mich in meine neue Stelle’: meiner neuen
- p. 204 7.98b Also an erratic verb (see above)
- p. 205 7.9.3 Why is not source for Early New High German given?
- p. 206 ‘Die Motten fressen von/an den Pullover’: dem
- p. 206 The two examples with bedenken are unacceptable!
- p. 207 ‘a discussion of term’: ‘the term’ or just delete ‘term’
- p. 208 8.2.1 Be more precise with elements can intervene between particle and verb (comes later in the book but should be mentioned here already).
- p. 209 8.3b Really attested? Strange example.
- p. 211 8.6c Please explain what the examples show.
- p. 211 The contrast between blühen and verblühen is easily explained: verblühen denotes a change of state but blühen not (necessarily): Die Blumen blühen schon seit drei Tage/*Die Blumen verblühen schon seit drei Tagen. See also your data in 8.25 on page 217 which point into the same direction. It might be worth relating the discussion of the data.
- p. 212 8.2.3 Begrünen is derived from the verb grünen and not from the adjective grün (although grünen is derived from the adjective). Similarly, versalzen is derived from salzen which is derived from Salz.
- p. 212 ‘to cause somebody to not have a weapen’: weapon
- p. 212 8.12b begraben is also used metaphorically Ich begrabe meine Pläne; in this use no PP is allowed.
- p. 213 8.15b On aufessen and the prefixation of other incremental verbs, see Fleischhauer & Czardybon (2016).
- p. 214 ‘neither in without preverb’: delete in
- p. 214 Concerning 8.19: Be more precise with respect to the particle as ‘der arbeitende Student’ as well as ‘der mitarbeitende Student’ are possible. Similarly for 8.23 on page 216.
- p. 215 Further examples: One pair of examples illustrating fürchten might be enough.
- p. 215 I think abkühlen is derived from the verb kühlen and not directly from the adjective kühl. There also exists verbs like kranken, wachen, röten such that the prefixed verbs are not directly derived from the adjective but from the deadjectival verbs.
- p. 217 ‘*geschwundenen Vorräte’: not ungrammatical: Gerne informieren wir Sie hiermit über eine besondere Aktion, damit Sie Ihre während der Pandemie geschwundenen Vorräte wieder auffüllen können. (https://www.apeval.ch/wallis/renommierte-raclettekase-hochqualitative-weine.html; 06.01.2022) The same for *die gefaulten Äpfel (various attestations at Google). Also: *die gegangenen Gäste, e.g. Die eben gegangenen Gäste haben gar nicht bezahlt. This somehow questions the view expressed in 8.4.5
- p. 218 8.4.7 Here again are erratic verbs. Somehow you are missing semantic generalizations which might be easily possible.
- p. 219 8.28b The reflexive is optional: Ich sehe gerade ein Buch an.
- p. 219 ‘Ich übe mir den Tango an’: anüben does not exist.
- p. 221 ‘Ich verheirate Paul und Marie’: I prefer verheiraten mit.
- p. 221 ‘Der Sturm treibt die Wrackteile an’: Punctuation mark is missing. 
- p. 221 8.35a The sentence is strange!
- p. 221 8.63 Add Die Pflanze grünen
- p. 222 I think verbessern is derived from the verb bessern not directly from the comparative.
- p. 222 I do not think that the meaning of erbitten can be derived from the adjective bitter. According to the DWDS, it is early used figuratively and the literal meaning ‘bitter machen’ is rather rare. I also think that entrunden is derived from runden and not from rund.
- p. 223 Beschädigen is derived from schädigen (Rauchen schädigt die Lunge) but not directly from Schaden.
- p. 223 ‘to cause not to have arms]’: Why ‘]’?
- p. 223 ‘The prefix entincludes in’: an
- p. 223 8.42c in dem Kapitän rather than in den Kapitän
- p. 223 8.42 Wouldn’t is better to provide English paraphrases?
- p. 223 8.43 The verbs have to distinct meanings. The same for the attested verbs below 8.43.
- p. 224 ‘Er verfuttert den Pferden das Tiermehl’: verfüttern (or füttert X an Y) but futtern cannot be used.
- p. 226 ‘to wonder:’ is missing
- p. 226 8.50c Punctuation mark is missing 
- p. 226 ‘an accusative arguemnt’: argument 
- p. 226 ‘Die Polizei hat den Dieb gegriffen’: ergriffen but you can say ‘Der Polizist hat die Kaffeetasse gegriffen’; greifen and eingreifen are different lexemes. The same is true of trinken and ertrinken.
- p. 227 8.52b mir instead of mich
- p. 227 8.53 For a look at Stiebels (1996) for erratic verbs.
- p. 229 ‘Ich gebe dem Buch einen Umschlag’: Might be ok in a context (technical use) but out of context the sentence is somehow strange as a book cannot be a recipient. If one accepts the sentence, it means ‘I am decorating the book with a cover’ or ‘I am producing a cover for it’.
- p. 229 ‘Ich besinge dich mit einem Lied’: in rather than mit. (Der Schlottwitzer Heimatmusiker Hanskarl König hat ein neues Lind veröffentlicht. In diesem besingt er Sachsens Dampfeisenbahnen. https://www.saechsische.de/glashuette/glashuette-schlottwitzer-besingt-die-schmalspurbahnen-5578593- plus.html; 07.01.2022) Also possible without PP (Die Klasse 4c besingt den Herbst https://www.ggs-paffrath.de/201718-2/schuljahr-201516/die-klasse-4c-besingt-den-herbst-2/; 07.01.2022).
- p. 229 It is claimed that unprefixed steigen necessarily requires a location-PP but consider examples like Die Temperatur/Der Goldpreis/Das Flugzeug steigt. For an intensive discussion of steigen cf. Löbner (1979) and Fleischhauer & Gamerschlag (2014).
- p. 229 8.59a Mann instead of Man
- p. 230 ‘Ich bin durchgelaufen’: durch does not have a spatial meaning but means ‘without a pause’
- p. 230 ‘Der Gefangene bricht aus dem Gefängnis’: bricht aus dem Gefängnis aus; the same with Ich ziehe aus dem Haus, here you need Ich ziehe aus dem Gefängnis aus.
- p. 230 8.61b Why ‘*’? The sentence is all right
- p. 230 8.61c/d Hunger with capital letter; the same in 8.62 for Hunger and Hund.
- p. 230 8.62c The sentence is not acceptable; the same for the sentence in d.
- p. 231 ‘Ich habe den Faden durchgezogen’: a durch-PP is missing and it is, if left out, implicit. You can only leave it out if it is inferable from the context.
- p. 232 ‘Ich schenke den Wein in das Glas’: in das Glase in 
- p. 233 ‘effect of the addition of preverb’: of a/the preverb
- p. 232 ‘Die Aufgabe belästigt mich’: The example is odd and I think belästigen requires an animate subject argument.
- p. 235 8.8.7 I think the sentences in the further examples should be presented in a different order.
- p. 8.78b Punctuation mark is missing.
- p. 237 8.79a wuchert not wuchern
- p. 237 ‘Ich laufe auf meinen neuen Schuhen’: in not auf
- p. 237 ‘Das Brautpaar tanzt auf den Ball’: dem Ball; ‘Das Brautpaar hat den Ball angetanzt’: I think antanzen (at least in this use) does not exist.
- p. 238 Further examples of 8.8.10.3: A number of the examples occurs repeatedly (partially already on page 237).
- p. 238 ‘in which there is’: there
- p. 238 8.82a I find the first sentence strange, although the second one is fine.
- p. 239 8.84c: Does not work for me.
- p. 239 ‘Ich verschlampe meine Aufgaben’ and ‘Ich verzögere die Maßnahmen’: Punctuation marks are missing
- p. 240 8.89a The example is strange; maybe ‘Das Wasser spült unter der Straße entlang‘, otherwise spülen is used as meaning ‘to clean dishes’.
- p. 240 8.90a The sentence is ungrammatical with the zu-PP. The same for Ich klage zu dir below. And also Ich lüge zu dir on page 243.
- p. 241 ‘into an aaccusative arguement’: argument 
- p. 241 8.92a das Unrecht
- p. 242 8.94d The sentence does not work, the only alternative to (a) is Ich strebe ein hohes Amt an.
- p. 243 8.97c/d: Both sentences are fine.
- p. 245 ‘Die Polizei jagte auf einen Verbrecher’: without auf
- p. 245 ‘Ich füge eine Zollerklärung zu dem Paket’: Ich füge eine Zollerklärung dem Paket zu
- p. 247 ‘Ich male die Wand an mit einem Gemälde’: Ich male die Wand mit Farbe an; Gemälde is not possible and an should go to the end.
- p. 247 8.106 is identical to 8.104
- p. 247 ‘Ich besegle den See mit meinem Boot’: I am not sure whether besegln exists; use an attested example please.
- p. 247 ‘Ich belege den Flur mit einem Teppich’: Does not work but use ‘Ich belege das Brot mit Käse’; like in other examples, the alternation affects the selectional restricts which might also be worth mentioning in the volume. You do not need the last example on the page as it illustrated legen/belegen again.
- p. 248 8.107b in not mit but than the referent of dich is the topic of the song.
- p. 248 ‘Ich verrauche das Schlafzimmer mit einer Zigarette’: No! What you mean is verqualmen.
- p. 248 ‘Ich stelle den Schrank im Korridor’: in den Korridor
- p. 248 ‘Er hat Feldsteinen in den Zugang gebaut’: Feldsteine
- p. 249 8.110a um den Arm or auf/über die Wunde but not um die Wunde 
- p. 251 The sentence after example 9.1 is incomplete.
- p. 251 9.2c in dem Teich
- p. 252 ‘it remain unclear’: remains
- p. 252 ‘There are some special context’: contexts
- p. 253 Rather than speaking of a comparison phrase it might be more accurate speaking of an equative construction since a (verbal) comparative looks differently (e.g. Das Flugzeug ist teurer als das Boot; Das Flugzeug rast mehr als das Boot).
- p. 253 It is stated that adverbials like gestern have scope over the predicate but it is widely assumed that they do not modify the predicate but (semantically speaking) the entire situation and therefore have larger structures within their scope.
- p. 254 9.10a The sentence also has the meaning ‘I bought a store and it (= the store) was empty’, cf. 9.12
- p. 254 ‘The preferred analysis of the resultative construction’: preferred by whom? References?
- p. 255 On the top of the page, it is argued against an analysis of ‘Der Duden’. The argumentation why the author’s analysis is preferred is missing. Please provide arguments supporting your analysis.
- p. 255 Section 10.2.8.]: delete ‘]’
- p. 255 9.17 & 9.18 Also Das Buch kostet viel vs. Das Buch kostet (aber). See Gamerschlag (2014) for such verbs/verb uses.
- p. 256 9.19e nimmt instead of benimmt
- p. 256 ‘similarly always needs’: need
- p. 256 9.20c: OK in context: Du führst dich heute aber wieder auf.
- p. 257 9.23b The sentence is ok, especially if you add nicht at the end. 
- p. 259 9.28e The sentence is ungrammatical.
- p. 259 ‘Ich lache mich tot/kaput/schlapp’: Punctuation mark is missing.
- p. 259 ‘Ich arbiete mich tot’: arbeite
- p. 260 9.30a I prefer ist rather than hat.
- p. 260 ‘Ich koche den Reis kauptt’: Kaputt does not work here but you can use gar. 
- p. 261 ‘nominative with a obligatory’: an
- p. 261 ‘also note that connection’: the connection 
- p. 261 9.34a schneide not scheine
- p. 262 9.35b Punctuation mark is missing. See also Gamerschlag (2014) for a discussion of similar data.
- p. 264 9.39c Not ungrammatical but a real reflexive!
- p. 264 9.41b I think such sentences are attested but with different arguments: Diese Maßnahme bindet zu viele Finanzmittel. But this might be a metaphorical use of binden.
- p. 265 ‘Ich steckt das Geld in meiner Tasche’: meine
- p. 265 9.7.7 There you use sattessen rather than sattsehen and I think it should be sattsehen.
- p. 266 ‘to a transitive verb lead’: leads
- p. 266 ‘as discusses’: as discussed; in the following line, the example is not done correctly.
- p. 266 ‘Ich falle meine Hose kaputt’: I do not like the sentence, is this attested?
- p. 267 line 3 ‘voll’ should be in italics; delete * in front of ‘voll’
- p. 268 9.48b in instead of auf
- p. 268 ‘Ich kritzle/schreibe Buchstaben in dem Buch’: das Buch
- p. 268 ‘Ich packe den Wagen voll (mit Einkäufe)’: Einkäufen
- p. 271 ‘The allomorphs without geshow show’: repetition
- p. 273 10.8b I prefer gelogen to go to the end.
- p. 273 Weinen is mentioned as being a manner of speaking verb, is this really justified? I do not think that this is appropriate.
- p. 275 ‘between participles as secondary predicate’: predicates 
- p. 276 10.18c Strange
- p. 276 ‘focus on slightly’: the slightly
- p. 277 10.22a I think the sentence is ok, especially if you add den ganzen Tag.
- p. 277 Why is the bleiben construction not tense-oriented? I do not think that this is justified and haven’t found any conclusive argumentation in favor of this view. See also my comment on 10.22a
- p. 277 10.23b kind with capital K
- p. 278 10.26b I am not convinced: Das wurde zwar gestern repariert, aber es ist immer noch nicht ganz fertig, da noch ein Ersatzteil fehlt is not contradictory (in my view).
- p. 280 Please explain table 10.1 (there is no reference to the table in the body of the text). What is the claim behind the ‘+’ and ‘-‘ signs? Is it claimed that some verbs lack a werden future? I cannot make sense of the table.
- p. 282 10.37b Ambiguous without bekommen, it can either means that his hair has been cut or that we has cutting. There is no ambiguity if bekommen is present.
- p. 282 10.39c Passive is also possible: Immer wenn ich durch den Wald fahre, wird mein Fahrrad schmutzig.
- p. 283 Line 1: translations of German verbs are missing
- p. 283 ‘The light verbs’: verb; translation is missing; also the translations below 10.41 are missing. Translations below 10.43 (page 284) are missing as well.
- p. 283 ‘different kinds of construction’: constructions
- p. 283 10a I think the second sentence is not acceptable, I prefer Ich finde, dass das Projekt gescheitert ist.
- p. 284 10.46b Punctuation mark is missing
- p. 285 ‘Likewise, DWDS’: provide a concrete reference
- p. 285 Denominal verbs of the type ölen are also discussed in Fleischhauer (2016).
- p. 286 It is mentioned that geregnet is from Regen but the participle is derived from the verb regnen.
- p. 287 ‘in the DWDS corpus only a few examples...’: Be more precise on the numbers.
- p. 287 10.54b I prefer sein over haben.
- p. 288 ‘distinguished from meaning of’: from the meaning; the same for 10.63a on page 291. 
- p. 291 ‘process leading the this state’: to
- p. 291 10.64b Is the use of haben maybe a dialectal feature? It might be worth discussing this issue as I think sein is more common.
- p. 292 10.69c (second sentence) sein is possible as well. Is this regional variation? I clearly prefer sein although haben is (marginally) acceptable!
- p. 293 10.74b Also possible: Sie haben den Saal gestürmt. 
- p. 293 10.75b (second sentence): I prefer sein.
- p. 293 10.76a (second sentence): Odd
- p. 294 Concerning 10.77a it is mentioned that it seems to be old-fashioned. I disagree, this is quite common.
- p. 294 ‘Verbs verbs with an’: repetition
- p. 294 ‘have an intransitive usage with a reflexive pronouns’: pronoun
- p. 294 10.4.4 It is not always clear whether we are dealing with a perfect or a passive construction. It might be useful if the author could provide clear criteria to distinguish between the two construction types.
- p. 295 ‘of the transitive (10.82a).’: transitive verb
- p. 295 10.82c des Lärms
- p. 296 10.85a Please check the example again, the verb should be in the plural.
- p. 296 10.85b sein not haben
- p. 297 10.86b The two sentences illustrate two different verbs.
- p. 297 ‘Er ist in einer prekären Situation geraten’: eine prekäre
- p. 297 10.97a Punctuation mark is missing. In the second sentence, sein is also possible. This is mentioned on the next page (10.91b), why not earlier?
- p. 299 10.93c aus seinem Zimmer
- p. 299 10.95 Punctuation marks are missing.
- p. 300 Last sentence of further examples: Punctuation mark is missing. 
- p. 302 ‘In some situations it is even possible to construction’: construct 
- p. 306 ‘shows a parallel to the real passives’: show
- p. 306 ‘unpersönlicher Passiv’: unpersönliches
- p. 307 10.11 Why are imperatives used there?
- p. 308 10.113 Auf and an require accusative: den not dem
- p. 308 ‘allow for a impersonal’: an
- p. 309 10.117b des Protests; I think the sentence is ungrammatical without werden.
- p. 310 10.121a/b Both are very almost ungrammatical. In c. substitute die by diese.
- p. 311 ‘gehoren + Patrtizip’: gehören
- p. 312 10.124b The sentence is not ungrammatical but perfectly acceptable. In c, geöffnet should go to the end. The first sentence in c is also perfectly acceptable.
- p. 312 10.125 (and further examples): punctuation marks are missing.
- p. 312 10.126b The sentence neither contains scheinen nur erscheinen.
- p. 314 10.132 Missing space between als and ob. The sentence in b-d are not really acceptable.
- p. 316 10.135a/b The second sentence in each example is odd.
- p. 316 I disagree that 10.137b is old-fashioned, this is quite common.
- p. 316 Below 10.137 ** instead of italics, should be changed.
- p. 317 ‘A verb peculiar constructions’: very peculiar construction
- p. 318 10.141b Start with capital letter.
- p. 319 10.148b Instead of mir one has to say an mich.
- p. 319 ‘*Das Kind ist unter die Decke gelegt...’: Why *? The sentence is ok.
- p. 320 ‘Ich lege/setzen/stecken’: setze/stecke
- p. 320 ‘Ich passe den Anzug’: ungrammatical
- p. 320 ‘*Sein Mitarbeiter ist geschätzt.’: The sentence is ok, especially if you add ‘von allen Kollegen/Kunden‘.
- p. 320 ‘Das Auto ist (*gebraucht) verbraucht.’: Gebraucht is ok (= is is not new/it is used; cf. Gebrauchtwagen) but verbraucht is not ok.
- p. 320 ‘*Meine Schätze sind gezeigt’: Is ok, cf. Meine paar Schätze sind schnell gezeigt. 
- p. 322 ‘Er hat sich gefürchtet gemacht’: I think this is odd.
- p. 323 Leirbukt*: delete *
- p. 323 10.155 abgenommen should go after the optional PP
- p. 324 ‘Retention is much more widespread With’: with
- p. 324 ‘while a durative perfect’: time adverbial rather than perfect
- p. 325 10.160 den Chef not die Chef
- p. 325 ‘there is an strong’: a
- p. 325 10.163b The sentence is ok and means ‘Yesterday, I did this and that’
- p. 326 10.164b auf meiner Schulter
- p. 326 10.164c am Brennen; more natural is an example like Ich habe meinen Kaim gerade am Brennen. am Brennen haben is a Funktionsverbgefüge.
- p. 327 10.166/167b von requires the dative von dem; in both sentences, I find von less acceptable than über.
- p. 327 See also the paper from Wiskandt (2021) on psych verbs and reflexive marking. ‘Er is amüsiert über den Witz’: odd; ‘Er ist enttäuscht über dein Benehmen’: I like von more; also deinem Benehmen
- p. 328 ‘Ihre Großmut macht mich beschämt’: The sentence is strange, without machen ist much better: Ihr Großmut beschämt mich.
- p. 329 10.173b Kunstwerk
- p. 330 10.177b why ?; I think the sentence is ok.
- p. 331 10.182b The sentence is very strange.
- p. 332 ‘Man weiß sich dabei nicht gesichert. Sie wussten sich durch ihn gewahrt.‘: Are these sentences attested?
- p. 333 ‘Ich sehe mich gezwungen...’: Strange sign at the end
- p. 334 10.190a/b schwillt not schwellt
- p. 335 10.191c Is this attested? Zufrieren with capital letter.
- p. 335 10.9.1 Some examples contain am others do not. Is this really compatible or are these two different constructions?
- p. 339 11.7c Why not the indicative form of the verb? 
- p. 339 ‘Both these construction’: constructions
- p. 341 11.10c The sentence is all right.
- p. 342 Möglichkeitspassiv und Permissivpassiv are only vaguely distinct, might it be the case that animacy of the subject argument determines the interpretation? Can you provide clearer (semantic) test criteria for distinguishing the two readings?
- p. 342 11.13b The sentence is very strange, I prefer ‘Der Berg lässt sich einfach/gut von Besuchern besteigen’; without such an adverb the sentence has a strong permissive flavor. But what about a sentence like: ‘Die Seelöwen lassen sich von den Besuchern füttern’ (a permissive as well as a possibility reading seems possible).
- p. 343 ‘causes to event to happen’: the event; the paragraph also contains two occurrences of passivkausativ without capital ‘P’. Further: ‘Besides the different in role’: difference.

> done

- p. 343 11.18b ausziehen not auszeihen
- p. 343 11.18c The sentence is ok, cf. Der Vater lässt das Baby von seinem Sohnausziehen/wickeln/baden/tragen. But I prefer the von-PP to be realized. Also true for 11.55c.
- p. 344 11.4.1 I am not sure whether the construction really expresses progressive aspect. One might also encounter examples like ‘Ich tat dir das Buch zu deinem sechsten Geburtstag schenken’. Also I personally do not like the tun-construction.
- p. 344 ‘in german orthography’: German
- p. 344 11.20b What about Das Haus blieb monatelang unverkauft, trotz aller Bemühungen der Makler? I think such sentences are acceptable and show that bleiben and the infinitive do not form a single word.
- p. 345 11.23c Punctuation mark is missing.
- p. 346 11.24b Punctuation mark is missing.
- p. 346 11.4.6 In what sense is the object incorporated? I do not think that this is morphological incorporation, it might be pseudo-incorporation. The same is true of mentioning incorporation on pages 351 and 352. I also disagree with the analysis on page 397 concerning Haareschneiden.
- p. 348 11.28c also possible with zu
- p. 348 11.30c The sentence Ich werden bestimmt von einer Biene gestochen werden, wenn ihr mir den Zucker nicht von den Händen waschen kann is all right. So, I disagree with the author’s judgement.
- p. 352 (see Section 11.5.1: closing bracket is missing.
- p. 352 11.45a übersieht not überseht
- p. 354 11.50b/c The participles should go to the end of the sentences.
- p. 355 11.51a The participle should go to the end of the sentence. The same holds for 11.53b - p. 356 11.54c I think the interpretation that she allows the dishes to be washed is possible.
- p. 356 ‘the use if participle’: of the
- p. 357 ‘this appears only to a’: to be a
- p. 357 ‘Enzinger (2012: 33-)’: why -?
- p. 357 11.58b I think the permissive reading is the more natural one. Meaning, there is also a permissive reading.
- p. 360 ‘in this class verbs’: either delete verbs or write class of verbs
- p. 363 ‘of the lexical verb simply are simply retained’: delete the first occurrence of simply
- p. 363 11.75b Why ‘?’
- p. 364 ‘Der Eintritt kostet mir 10 Euro’: mich
- p. 365 ‘Der Teller steht ihm auf den Tisch’: Ungrammatical, only ok without ihm.
- p. 367 Paragraph after 12.1: already said earlier.
- p. 371: First sentence: Maybe a quantitative study would be interesting to support this claim.
- p. 371 12.9a Also possible: dass er rechtzeitig nach hause zu kommen verspricht.
- p. 371 12.9b Also possible: dass der Film verspricht eine Sensation zu werden.
- p. 372 12.13c ‘*^’: delete ‘^’
- p. 373 ‘Er hat noch ein Jahr zu leben’: Does this example really fit semantically into the category? Maybe just if it is interpreted as meaning: after a year, he will be killed.
- p. 374 12.21a (second sentence) denkt not denken
- p. 374 12.21c (second sentence): Odd; the sentence in (d) is better than this one
- p. 376 Below 12.25: Where do the numbers exactly come from? The sum is just 90%, what about the remaining 10%? How are the numbers calculated? What is the basis for their calculation?
- p. 378 12.31 I think the following examples are ok: Von 13 bis 15 Uhr ist Ruhe zu halten/ Lärm und Ballspielen zu unterlassen. Ab hier ist Schritt/langsam zu fahren.
- p. 380 ‘This constructions is’: construction
- p. 383 ‘Dieses glas’: Glas
- p. 384 ‘Verbs without an accusative argument can used’: can be used
- p. 384 ‘there actually appears to be quite good match’: a quite good match 
- p. 385 ‘Huge von Hofmannsthal’: Hugo
- p. 388 ‘the bleiben+zu-Infinitiv construction’: The
- p. 388 12.53b I prefer ‘für diese Ausstellung zu danken’
- p. 388 12.54c/d The examples contain Funktionsverbgefüge. 
- p. 394 13.14a denke or denkt not denken
- p. 394 13.14d I prefer gedenken. With gedenken it means ‚He is planning to travel‘, with denken it means ‘He believes he will travel’.
- p. 394 ‘A example of a light verb’: an
- p. 395 13.16b des Schälens not dem Schälen
- p. 395 13.16c dem Einkaufen not von dem Einkaufen
- p. 395 13.4.1 There are also am-progressives with a definite direct object (at least in the area where I come from): Er ist die Kartoffeln am Lesen; Ich bin die Karroffelm am Kochen.
- p. 396 ‘that that im progressive’: repetition
- p. 396 am schwimmen and am dampfen: should be with capital letter
- p. 397 13.4.4 It is claimed that the construction expresses that an activity is performed regularly/habitually but I am not sure that this is true. Is there any evidence to support this view? I think one can say: Während ich beim Arbeiten war, rief mich meine Frau fünf Mal an. This is clearly neither a habit nor a regularity.
- p. 397 ‘I will not analyses’: analyze
- p. 399 I am not convinced that 13.26 really represents an instance of a metonymical shift as you can say: Ich bin zum Massieren in den Massagesalon gegangen. In this sentence, Massieren cannot refer to the place of the action which is explicitly realized in the in-PP.
- p. 400 13.28a I am not convinced of the analysis of the example as you can say Er kommt am Mittwoch um 15 Uhr vom Einkaufen, dann kannst du ihn treffen.
- p. 400 13.4.7 Kommen is usually analyzed as an inchoative Funktionsverb, see Fleischhauer & Hartmann (2021). It might be useful to adopt this kind of terminology for naming the constructions which, in my view, is just a Funktionsverbgefüge. Thus, I am not sure whether it should really be contained in a volume on alternations.
- p. 400 It is stated that the construction in 13.4.7 exemplifies different interpretations. This is an interesting observation and it represents what is called ‘families of light verb constructions’ in, for example, Fleischhauer (in press).
- p. 401 13.31a (second sentence) start with a capital letter
- p. 403 ‘Den habe ich immer am Hacken’: Hacken is not a verb but the noun Hacke (= Ferse).
