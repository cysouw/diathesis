# Setting the scene

## The daunting diversity of diathesis

The quintessential example of German diathesis, found in virtually every grammatical descriptions of German, is the *werden + Infinitiv* passive construction \Next[a]. A central characteristic of this construction is that the state-of-affairs as described by this passive is essentially the same as in the corresponding active \Next[b], though the sentence structure of course differs between the two expressions.

\ex.
 \a. Das Gemälde wird (von einem Künstler) gemalt.
 \b. Der Künstler malt ein Gemälde.

This approach to diathesis, viz. different grammatical sentence structures that express approximately the same state-of-affairs, is applicable to a large number of grammatical phenomena in German. For example, some verbs allow for passive-like constructions without any *werden* auxiliary, often called 'anticausative' \Next[a]. Other verbs allow for an alternation between a case-marked accusative and a prepositional phrase, often called 'antipassive' \Next[b]. Further, there exist many different kinds of diathesis marked by a reflexive pronoun *sich* \Next[c] or marked by preverbs like *ent-* \Next[d]. Many auxiliary-like construction beyond the *werden + Infinitiv* passive also show diathesis, e.g. *sein + zu + Infinitive* \Next[e].^[Many examples in this book contain masculine nouns, not because of laziness on my behalve, but because their definite articles overtly show the different German cases (*der, des, dem, den*). Notwithstanding this grammatical preference, I will try to use examples with as much diversity as possible throughout this book.]

\ex.
 \a. Der Doktor heilt den Schmerz. Der Schmerz heilt (durch den Doktor).
 \b. Der Jäger schießt den Bären. Der Jäger schießt auf den Bären.
 \c. Der Lehrer beklagt den Lärm. Der Lehrer beklagt sich über den Lärm.
 \d. Der Kandidat stammt aus einem Adelsgeschlecht. Der Kandidat entstammt einem Adelsgeschlecht
 \e. Der Ermittler löst den Fall. Der Fall ist (für den Ermittler) leicht zu lösen.

All in all, there are about 200 different German diatheses described in this book, some highly productive, some only attested for a handful of verbs. The main goal of this book is to present this wealth of grammatical possibility in a unified manner, while at the same time attempting to classify and organise this diversity. There is no attempt made to fit all these constructional possibilities of the German language into any specific grammatical framework. However, by simply organising all this information there are already various generalisation appearing along the way.

It might come as a surprise that there are so many different diatheses in German, but my impression is that German is no exception among the world's languages in this respect. I expect that all languages have a wealth of different ways in which to construe a sentence around a lexical predicate. In a sense, diatheses allow for the expression of different perspectives on the event described, something that is arguably a common desire of any language user. Looking at it this way, diathesis belongs squarely in the same domain of grammatical analysis as tense, aspect, mood or evidentiality.

In this book, each diathesis has its own sub-subsection with an unique section header that can be used as a name to refer to the diathesis. Many of these unique names are quite boring, but hopefully descriptively useful for future reference. Individual verbs (often with concrete examples) are listed with each diathesis to show the extend of its applicability. Neither these lists of verbs nor the examples are intended to be exhaustive in any way. They should be seen as a first step towards more in-depth research into individual diatheses or into the different constructional possibilities that exist for individual verbs.

The current attempt to present a all-encompassing survey of German diathesis builds on a rich scholarly tradition (with many scholarly precursors to be cited in appropriate places throughout this work). A comparable and highly influential survey of diathesis for English is Levin [-@levin1993], followed by a similar attempt for German by Sauerland [-@sauerland1994]. A recent cross-linguistic survey of valency and diathesis in this tradition is edited by Malchukov & Comrie [-@malchukov2015a], which also includes data on German [@haspelmath2013a]. Independent of Levin's work, there is a long tradition in the German grammatical literature to investigate diathesis, e.g. as "Konversenverhältnis der Aktanten" [@eroms1980: 24; cf. @heringer1968]. Basic summaries of german diathesis in the context of valency can be found in Eroms [-@eroms2000: Ch. 10] or Ágel [-@agel2000: Ch. 6]. There even exist a few monographies about specific German diatheses [e.g. @leirbukt1997; @holl2010; @jager2013] and recently some corpus studies into the effect of specific diatheses on individual verbs have appeared [@devaere2018; @imo2018].

Diathesis is of course closely linked to the concept of valency, so the groundbreaking valency dictionary for German by Helbig and Schenkel [-@helbig1991] deserves mentioning. They identify the problem that certain verbs can be used in different constructions, but diatheses are not investigated in their dictionary. Another highly influential valency dictionary for German, edited by Schumacher [-@schumacher1986], consistently discusses passive diatheses for all verb. I see my survey of German diatheses as a first step in extending such valency dictionaries into even more all-encompassing dictionaries that discuss all possible clause constructions for each verb.

## Defining diathesis {#sec:intro-basic-defintion}

A diathesis is defined here as special kind of alternation between two different clause constructions. To properly define the notion 'diathesis', I will first define 'alternation' in general. Next, the definition of 'clause alternation' will be built on that basis. Finally, a diathesis will then be defined as special kind of clause alternation. A few crucial concepts that are used in the following definitions will be discussed in more detail in subsequent sections.

An \textsc{alternation} (or simply 'grammatical marking') is defined as follows:

- An alternation consist of two different linguistic constructions, i.e. there are two **alternants**.
- The lexical root does not change in the alternation, i.e. there is some linguistic material in both alternants that remains the same.
- The difference between these alternants is overtly indicated by the presence of some grammatical linguistic elements.
- Typically, the overt marking introduces a **direction** into the alternation, i.e. one alternant consists of less/shorter/zero linguistic elements ('less marked') and one consists of more/longer/overt linguistic material ('more marked').
- In some cases, the direction of the alternation remains undecidable, i.e. the alternation is **equipollent**.

Alternations are the basis of all grammatical analysis. It includes for example (i) morphological oppositions like singular *Haus* 'house' vs. plural *Häuser* 'houses'; (ii) different grammatical forms like synthetic present *er schläft* 'he sleeps' vs. analytic perfect *er hat geschlafen* 'he has slept'; or (iii) different sentence constructions attested with specific verbs, like transitive *Ich verkaufe das Buch* 'I sell the book' vs. reflexive anticausative with obligatory adverbial *Das Buch verkauft sich gut* 'the book is selling well' (see [@sec:adverbial-reflexive-transitive-anticausative]).

Based on this definition of an alternation, a \textsc{clause alternation} is defined as follows:

- In a clause alternation **both alternants are monoclausal**, i.e. both alternants contain a single main predicate. For German, the main argument for monoclausality will be a phenomenon called 'coherence'.
- In both alternants, the **main predicate consists of the same lexeme**, i.e both contain the same verb.
- The **meaning of the lexical verb does not change*** (substantially) between the alternants. 
- The **meaning/function of the whole clause is different** between the alternants. This functional difference is the whole point of having a clause alternation in the first place.
- The **lexical roles of the verb do not change** between the alternants. Lexical roles are an inherent part of the meaning of a verb and alternations do not change them. Note, however, that there might be new roles introduced or some roles might be left unexpressed.
- A specific clause alternation is only applicable to a restricted set of verbs. The list of applicable verbs constitutes the **domain of application** of the alternation. Any semantic/syntactic characterisation of these applicable verbs should be seen as a summary of the domain of application, not its definition.

Clause alternations are widespread when auxiliaries are introduced, like modal *müssen* 'have to' \Next[a], see [@sec:infinitive-mussen]. Moreover, clause alternation are attested with many different kind of marking, like the verb particle *auf* marking completeness of the action \Next[b], see [@sec:prepositions-accusative-antipassive], or the somewhat mysterious 'free' reflexive *sich* with verbs like *ansehen* 'look at' \Next[c], see [@sec:reflexive-free-dative-sich-accusative]. Arguably, the special word order in German subordinate clauses (viz. the finite verb occurs clause-final) can also be considered to be a clause alternation.

\ex.
 \a. Er erledigt seine Hausaufgaben. Er muss seine Hausaufgaben erledigen.
 \b. Ich esse den Apfel. Ich esse den Apfel auf.
 \c. Er hat das Haus angesehen. Er hat sich das Haus angesehen.
 \d. Er erledigt seine Hausaufgaben. Ich hoffe, dass er seine Hausaufgaben erledigt.

Based on the notion of a clause alternation, a \textsc{diathesis} (sometimes also known as 'valency alternation') is defined as follows:

- A diathesis is a clause alternation in which at least one of the lexical roles is overtly marked differently between the clausal alternants, i.e. **at least one of the roles is remapped** (i.e. there is a role-marking alternation).
- Reframed roles do not substantially change their meaning, i.e. **'who does what to whom' does not change**.
- The details of the relation between the main predicate and the reframed roles can (and normally will) change. There will be **changes in meaning**, e.g. aspects like the role's influence on the action or its affectedness by the predicate might change.
- As an extreme case, the reframing of a role might consist in the **addition** of a completely new role or in the **complete removal** of an existing role.
- As is true for all alternations, a diathesis has a **direction** from a formally 'less marked' to a 'more marked' alternant. However, in some special instances a diathesis can show no other overt marking than the change in marking of the reframed roles itself, i.e. a **bare diathesis** (or 'equipollent' diathesis).
- As a practical restriction, I will only consider diatheses in which one alternant is a clauses with a single finite verb ('active').

The prototypical example of a diathesis is the *werden + Partizip* passive \Next[a], see [@sec:participles-werden-passive]. In both clause alternants the same state of affairs is described, but the marking of the participants is different. However, the diversity of diatheses in German is enormous as this book attempts to show. There are, for example, bare diatheses (i.e. diatheses without any marking on the verb) like the infamous anticausative in \Next[b], see [@sec:case-haben-anticausative], or antipassives marked with a reflexive pronoun as shown in \Next[c], see [@sec:reflexive-accusative-antipassive].

\ex.
 \a. Der Schreiner hat den Tisch angemalt. Der Tisch wurde von den Schreiner angemalt.
 \b. Ich koche den Kaffee. Der Kaffee kocht.
 \c. Der Fahrradfahrer fürchtet den Anstieg. Der Fahrradfahrer fürchtet sich vor den Anstieg.

Hidden in this succinct definition of diathesis there are various intricate grammatical concepts that need some more discussion in subsequent subsections.

## Definitional details

### Terminology

In the thorough cross-linguistic survey of diathesis by Zuñiga & Kittilä [-@zuniga2019], they distinguish between the terms 'diathesis', 'diathetical operation', 'grammatical voice' and 'transitivity'. I completely subscribe to these conceptual distinctions. However, I have decided to simplify my terminology and basically use the term 'diathesis' for all four concepts.

A diathesis (as defined here) is an alternation between two clausal construction. To be more precise, this is what is called a 'diathetical operation' in Zuñiga & Kittilä [-@zuniga2019: 4]. Each of the alternants show a different mapping of (grammatical) expressions onto (semantic) roles. Individually, each such mapping between expressions and roles is called a 'diathesis' in Zuñiga & Kittilä [-@zuniga2019: 4]. However, because I will only consider diathetical operations between an 'unmarked' and a 'marked' alternant, I have decided to simplify the terminology in this book. Both the alternation itself (Zuñiga & Kittilä's diathetical operation, e.g. 'causativization') and the marked alternant (Zuñiga & Kittilä's diathesis, e.g. 'causative') will be referred to here as diathesis. A side-effect of this approach is that 'active' is not in itself a diathesis, but simply the unmarked counterpart of a diathetical operation.

The actual linguistic marking of the diathesis (for example by verbal morphology or auxiliaries) is called 'grammatical voice' in Zuñiga & Kittilä [-@zuniga2019: 4]. In this book, each diathesis is defined as a combination of a (re-)mapping of roles and a specific kind of linguistic marking of the main predicate. So again, this extra terminological distinction is not necessary in this book. The formal expression ('grammatical voice') is simply a definitional part of each diathesis here.

The term 'transitivity' [@zuniga2019: 3; following @hopper1980] describes a (recurrent) connection between a diathetical operation and semantic effects on the meaning of the clause, e.g. when an accusative argument is remapped onto a prepositional phrase, this often implies less involvement of the argument. The details of such semantic effects of each of the diatheses in this book is a fascinating topic, for which I unfortunately can only offer limited insights throughout. In practice, I assume that each diathesis as described here has some kind of semantic effect, but the details of these effect need much more detailed research that has to be provided by subsequent work.

Finally, I prefer to use the term 'diathesis' over the frequently attested term 'valency alternation', because there are many diatheses (i.e. constructions with obviously reframed roles) in which the valency does not change between the alternants, e.g. \Next in which both sentences have a nominative, accusative and prepositional phrase. Strictly speaking, valency alternations are a subset of all diatheses.

\ex.
 \a. Ich schmiere Salbe auf die Wunde.
 \b. Ich beschmiere die Wunde mit Salbe.

### Monoclausality and coherence

Diatheses are defined above as alternations between single clauses with the same main verb. However, a single clause in German can sometimes consist of multiple verb forms. It is crucial to strictly distinguish between situations in which a multi-verb construction is monoclausal and when it is not. The basis of the definition of monoclausality in German is a concept called \textsc{coherence}.

All diatheses listed in this book are monoclausal. Besides trying to list all German diatheses, I will also list all non-diathesis clause alternation, i.e monoclausal alternations without any change in sentence structure (these are always listed in the .4 section of each chapter). This book can thus also be read as a listing of all German monoclausal constructions, with or without valency change. Somewhat unexpectedly, the number of alternations without any change in valency (i.e. the alternations without diathesis) is much smaller than the number of monoclausal alternations with changes in role marking (i.e. the diatheses).

To define monoclausality, the crucial characteristic of German syntax is that the finite verb is moved to the end of the sentence in a subordinate clauses. I will use the dummy main sentence *Es ist bekannt, dass ...* 'it is known that' to force a subordinate construction. The position of the finite verb in the subordinate clause can be used the identify the boundary of the clause: everything that can occur before the finite verb belongs to the clause; everything that has to come after the finite verb belongs to a different clause. For example, the simple sentence \Next[a] will turn into \Next[b] as a subordinate clause, with the finite verb at the end; \Next[c] is not possible (with any constituent after the finite verb), so the whole sentence in \Next[a] is a single clause. Constructions with such a pattern will be called \textsc{coherent}, following Bech [-@bech1955]; see also Kiss [-@kiss1995] for a more in-depth and more extensive discussion of the concept 'coherence'. Coherent constructions are considered to be \textsc{monoclausal}.

\ex.
 \a.    Ich gehe morgen nach Hause.
 \b.    Es ist bekannt, dass ich morgen nach Hause gehe.
 \c. \* Es ist bekannt, dass ich gehe morgen nach Hause.

Exactly the same coherence is attested in auxiliary constructions with participles \Next and infinitives \NNext. Such constructions are also monoclausal.

\ex.
 \a.    Ich habe gestern ein Haus gekauft.
 \b.    Es ist bekannt, dass ich gestern ein Haus gekauft habe.
 \c. \* Es ist bekannt, dass ich gestern gekauft habe ein Haus.

\ex.
 \a.    Ich will morgen ein Haus kaufen.
 \b.    Es ist bekannt, dass ich morgen ein Haus kaufen will.
 \c. \* Es ist bekannt, dass ich morgen kaufen will ein Haus.

Constructions with *zu* and infinitive are sometimes coherent, e.g. \Next with finite verb *gibt*, and sometimes non-coherent, e.g. \NNext with finite verb *hofft*. The coherent construction in \Next[a] is thus monoclausal, while the non-coherent construction in \NNext[a] consists of two clauses.

\ex.
 \a.    Der Protest gibt ihr zu denken.
 \b.    Es ist bekannt, dass der Protest ihr zu denken gibt.
 \c. \* Es ist bekannt, dass der Protest gibt ihr zu denken.

\ex.
 \a.    Der Sportler hofft den Wettkampf zu gewinnen.
 \b. \* Es ist bekannt, dass der Sportler den Wettkampf zu gewinnen hofft.
 \c.    Es ist bekannt, dass der Sportler hofft den Wettkampf zu gewinnen.

In some intermediate cases both orders are possible, as shown in \Next. These constructions will be called 'semi-coherent' here.

\ex.
 \a.    Ich helfe dir den Koffer zu tragen.
 \b.    Es ist bekannt, dass ich dir helfe den Koffer zu tragen.
 \c.    Es ist bekannt, dass ich dir den Koffer zu tragen helfe.

Maybe surprisingly, when the above definition of monoclausality is strictly followed, then there appear to be dozens of verbs that can be used as the finite 'auxiliary' in a coherent multi-verb construction. When used as finite auxiliaries, these verbs are strongly grammaticalised, i.e. they shed much of their lexical meaning when used in multi-verb constructions. Such grammaticalised verbs are classified into different groups and referred to by many different names in the German grammatical literature, e.g. *Hilfsverb*, *Kopulaverb*, *Modalverb*, *Modalitätsverb*, *Halbmodalverb* [@eisenberg2006a], *Funktionsverb* [Polenz 1963 cited in @kamber2008: 34], *Strukturverb* [@weber2005], or *Stützverb* [Seelbach 1991 cited in @kamber2008: 34]. I will not pursue the question here how to classify these verbs into different kinds. I will simply refer to the whole group of these 'auxiliary' verbs as \textsc{light verbs}. All light verbs that will be discussed in later chapters are shown here in alphabetical order in \Next, though note that not all of them are involved in diathesis. A minority of the verbs listed below are only attested in monoclausal alternation without diathesis.

\ex. German verbs that can be used as light verbs: *anfangen, aufhören, aussehen, beginnen, bekommen, bleiben, brauchen, bringen, drohen, dürfen, erscheinen, fahren, finden, fühlen, geben, gehen, gehören, gelten, glauben, haben, halten, heißen, helfen, hören, kommen, kriegen, können, lassen, legen, lehren, liegen, machen, möchten, mögen, müssen, nehmen, pflegen, riechen, scheinen, schicken, sehen, sein, setzen, sollen, spüren, stehen, tun, versprechen, werden, wirken, wissen, wollen*

### Grammaticalisation of lexical meaning

A difficult problem is the question whether it is really the same verb that is used in two alternating constructions of a diathesis. For example, the verb *trinken* 'to drink' is a regular transtive verb, but when used intransitively, *er trinkt* 'he drinks', it has a clear implication that his drinking includes too much alcohol, so it might be better translated as 'he is an alcoholic'. In this case, this intransitive interpretation is probably best analysed as a conventional implicature, because the alcoholism aspect of the meaning can be suppressed given the right context.

In general, when the same lexical verb is used in different alternating constructions, then there is (of course) a difference in meaning between the two occurrences. However, ideally this difference is completely induced by the respective constructions and not by the lexical verb itself. Yet, it is extremely common for the combination of a lexical verb with the surrounding construction to grammaticalise into a new meaning. For example, the verb *auftreten* means something like 'to act' as an intransitive, but *to kick open* as a transitive. Both meanings originate from the meaning 'to step on something (by foot)'. Likewise, historical processes can lead to current homophony of two different lexemes. This appears to be the case for example with the verb *abhauen*, which is a transitive verb meaning 'cut of' (e.g. *Er hat den Ast abgehauen*). However, it has attained another usage during the course of the 20th century as an intransitive verb meaning 'run away' (e.g. *Er ist abgehauen*), probably based on a southern German dialectal meaning of *hauen* 'to go, to walk' [@pfeiffer1993: "hauen", accessed 12.12.2018].

In between those extremes (i.e. conventional implicature and different lexicalisation) there exist various intermediate phenomena. For example, the verb *hängen* 'to hang' can be used as a regular intransitive verb with a location, like *Er hängt an einem Seil* 'He dangles to a rope', but the specific combination with the preposition *an* can also have a special reading of 'being emotionally attached to something', like in *Er hängt an seinem Teddy* 'He is (emotionally) attached to his Teddy'. In this case it seems most appropriate to interpret the combination *hängen an* as a separate lexicalisation, though the path of the conventional implicature can still be intuitively grasped.

As with all grammaticalisation processes, it is often difficult to decide where to draw the line on the continuum between conventional implicature, metaphorical extension (*trinken*) and contextual lexicalisation (*hängen an*) or completely different lexicalisation (*auftreten*, *abhauen*). I tend to be rather lenient in allowing slightly different meanings to be included as the 'same' verb, but will exclude clear examples of the latter two types on the continuum as separate lexicalisations of homophonous elements.

### Lexeme-specific lexical roles {#sec:intro-lexical-roles}

A crucial aspect of diathesis is that the lexical roles do not change, only the grammatical encoding of the roles changes. For example, the verb *füllen* 'to fill' occurs in various monoclausal constructions \Next, but the roles of (i) 'filler', (ii) 'filled container' and (iii) 'filling substance' are always the same. The different grammatical forms that are used to express these roles are added as subscripts to each sentence in the examples below.

\ex.
 \a. Ich~(i)\ NOM~ fülle den Topf~(ii)\ ACC~ (mit Reis~(iii)\ PREP~).
 \b. Ich~(i)\ NOM~ fülle den Reis~(iii)\ ACC~ in den Topf~(ii)\ PREP~.
 \c. Der Reis~(iii)\ NOM~ füllt (mir~(i)\ DAT~) den Magen~(ii)\ ACC~.
 \d. Der Blumentopf~(ii)\ NOM~ füllt sich (mit Wurzeln~(iii)\ PREP~).

Already from this example it becomes clear that it is often really difficult, if not impossible, to attach a specific valency to a verb. Given that most (and possibly all) German lexemes show some kind of diathesis, I reject the traditional notion of a fixed valency belonging to a specific verb (see [@sec:intro-valency] for a more extensive discussion). Alternatively, I propose that it is possibly to list all \textsc{lexeme-specific roles} (or equivalently \textsc{lexical roles}) as a fixed characteristic of each lexical verb. The following criteria will be used to determine the lexical roles of a verb:

First, each role that is case-marked in at least one clause-alternant is a lexeme-specific role. In the example of *füllen* in \Last, each of the three roles is marked as nominative, accusative or dative in at least one of the alternants, so all three roles are lexeme-specific. Various exceptions and stipulations to this criterion are discussed in [@sec:case-delimiting-arguments].

Second, all obligatory prepositional phrases are lexeme-specific roles. Such prepositional phrases, that cannot be left out, are not very widespread in German and mostly designate a location. Some verbs always expect such a location-role \Next[a,b], see e.g. [@sec:prepositions-obligatory-local; @sec:reflexive-obligatory-local], but more widespread are resultative diatheses that introduce an obligatory local role \Next[c,d], see e.g. [@sec:prepositions-action-result].

\ex.
 \a.    Der Stuhl befindet sich im Wohnzimmer
 \b. \* Der Stuhl befindet sich.
 \c.    Ich breche ein Loch in den Felsen.
 \d. \* Ich breche ein Loch.

Third, there is a large class of lexeme-specific prepositional phrases that I will call \textsc{governed prepositions}, like *arbeiten an* 'to work on' \Next[a]. These prepositional phrases are not obligatorily present \Next[b]. The intuition behind governed prepositions is that these prepositions are lexically determined by the verb and often strongly grammaticalised both semantically and structurally. Semantically, the preposition *an* with the verb *arbeiten* 'to work' \Next[a] is strongly bleached with none of its local 'touching' meaning remaining. Syntactically, the prepositional phrase in *arbeiten an* can be filled with a complement clause of the form *daran, dass …* \Next[c]. This syntactic criterion will be used as the main characteristic to identify governed prepositions. Various exceptions and stipulations to this criterion are discussed in [@sec:prepositions-delimiting-governed-prepositional-phrases]. 

\ex.
 \a. Ich arbeite an meinem Buch.
 \b. Ich arbeite hart.
 \c. Ich arbeite daran, dass das Buch fertig wird.

Under this approach, there are a few lexical roles that appear to be very widespread, up to the point of seemingly being universally applicable to all verbs. If that would be the case, then it would defeat the idea of lexeme-specific roles. However, on closer inspection my impression is that there are no roles that apply to all verbs. The closest contender is, arguably, the role of causer, which can be introduced to almost any German verb by using the *lassen + Infinitiv* diathesis \Next, see [@sec:infinitive-lassen-causative]. However, there is a small group of verbs that do not allow for this diathesis, like *gefallen* 'to like' \NNext. This shows that even virtually universal roles are still lexically determined.

\ex.
 \a. Der Student arbeitet an einer Aufgabe.
 \b. Der Professor lässt den Student an einer Aufgabe arbeiten.

\ex.
 \a. Dein Haarschnitt gefällt mir.
 \b. \* Er lässt mir seinen Haarschnitt gefallen.

Such lexeme-specific roles are called 'verb-specific semantic roles' in Van Valin [-@van-valin2004] and 'microroles' in Hartmann et al. [-@hartmann2014]. The obvious next step (as discussed in both these papers) is to cluster such microroles into clusters of semantic/thematic mesoroles, i.e. widespread roles like 'agent', 'patiens', 'experiencer' etc. Such semantic roles are used constantly in contemporary linguistics, but they are surprisingly ill-defined. For example, given a random German verb like *füllen* as exemplified at the start of this section: what should be its semantic roles, and what criteria should be used to determine this? Hartmann et al. [-@hartmann2014] and Cysouw [-@cysouw2014a] use cross-linguistic data to approach this question. However, such an approach does not allow for language-specific definitions, which is the problem in the current example of German.

My proposal for a language-specific determination of semantic mesoroles is to use the applicability of diatheses as a criterion. For example, a 'German Patiens' might be defined as those lexical roles that are changed from accusative to nominative in the *werden* passive diathesis. Or more general: a semantic role can be defined by a combination of applicable diatheses. The research project to determine suitable combinations of diatheses will not be pursued here, but left for a follow-up investigation.

### Domain of application

A widespread assumption in linguistic analysis is that most alternations (including diatheses) have a sensible domain of application. This is the idea that there is some rationale, often a kind of semantic characterisation, explaining which roots allow for a specific kind of linguistic marking (e.g. only transitive verbs allow for a *werden* passive). Although I also believe that many alternations, including diatheses, mostly behave sensibly, I would also warn not to expect too much regular (semantic) generalisations hidden in grammatical structure. Many grammatical regularities have unexpected exceptions, be it because of haphazard diachronic changes or through partial analogical extension. Even stronger, some grammatical marking appears to be almost completely without (semantic) rationale, like the assignment of plural allomorphy in German.

As a practical approach to the domain of application of a specific alternation (say, which verbs allow for the *werden* passive or the reflexive anticausative), I propose to always first enumerate as much examples as possible. In this book, I will not be satisfied with four or five cases that suggest a neat semantic coherence for a specific diathesis, but list as many as possible further examples, idiosyncratic as they may be. Only after such a formal listing of the domain of application (which ideally needs much more corpus research as I have been able to perform here) is it possible to investigate the presence of any (semantic) rationale. In many cases there might be a partial rationale, but it is just as likely (and just as interestingly) to have to conclude that there apparently is none.

Taking this principle one step further, I propose to *define* the domain of application as the concrete listing of all examples. Any (semantic) characterisation is then always a post-hoc generalisation, not a definition. This radically lexicalist interpretation is the approach that I will follow in this book. For each diathesis I will list as many as possible example verbs that take part in the diatheses (for some I will reverse the approach and list verbs that are not part of the domain of application). These lexical lists, ideally updated and completed in the future, are the definition of the domain of application. For some diatheses, I will speculate about semantic generalisations, but I consider these generalisations always to be secondary to the concrete listing of examples.

This principle of the definition by listing even holds for questions of productivity. For example, when somebody would propose a nonce-verb like *flurchten* to be a new verb for the German language in an experimental setting, then its meaning is partially defined by stating what kind of diatheses it can take part in. Depending on how such a new verb is contextualised, the following construction might or might not be judged grammatical. The choices that will be made influence the meaning of the verb.

\ex.
 \a. Ich flurchte den X.
 \b. Ich flurchte an den X.
 \c. Ich flurchte mich vor den X.
 \d. Der X flurchtet.
 \e. Der X flurchtet sich.

### Functional analysis

Intimately connected to the domain of application (i.e. which verbs allow for which diathesis) is the question as to the meaning/function of a specific diathesis. In essence, this question asks for a description of the difference between the meaning of the two alternants of a diathesis. For example, what is the difference between the transitive \Next[a] and the corresponding reflexive anticausative \Next[b], see [#sec:reflexive-anticausative].

\ex.
 \a. Ich schließe die Tür.
 \b. Die Tür schließt sich. 

In general, it turns out to be extremely difficult to give a concise description of such differences, and I will mostly refrain from trying to provide such descriptions. Each diathesis is actually its own research project, preferably investigated using predictive corpus analysis [cf. the large literature on the English dative alternation, for German see e.g. @devaere2018]. The actual lists of verbs that allow for a specific diatheses (i.e. the domain of application, see above) also seems to be an important datapoint to investigate the function of a diathesis.

The problem of a functional description for a diathesis becomes even more difficult with the realisation that there are dozens of diatheses, often highly similar to each other. For example, it is really difficult [cf. @schafer2007; @kurogo2016] to characterise the difference between the reflexive anticausative above in \Last and the unmarked anticausative in \Next, see [@sec:case-haben-anticausative]? 

\ex.
 \a. Ich koche den Kaffee.
 \b. Der Kaffee kocht.

An important side-note in this respect are those alternations that have similar formal characteristics as diatheses, but which do not have any role-remapping. Such sentence alternations are not considered to be diatheses here, but they are still discussed in the \.4 sections of each chapter. An example is the phenomenon of 'free' reflexives \Next, see [#sec:reflexive-free-dative-sich-accusative]. Although there is no role-remapping in this alternation (and thus no diathesis), it turns out to be really difficult to describe the difference between \Next[a] and \Next[b]. All sentence alternations, with or without role-remapping, are in need of a functional analysis, and most such analyses will involve substantial research.

\ex.
 \a. Ich habe das Haus angesehen.
 \b. Ich habe mir das Haus angesehen.

## Valency {#sec:intro-valency}

### Utterance valency and lexeme valency

Valency is traditionally interpreted as a fixed constructional characteristic of a lexical verb, e.g. the verb *geben* 'to give' is said to be ditransitive. A central thesis of this book is that this conception of valency is misguided. Individual verbs can (and normally will) be used in many different constructions with different valency (i.e. most verbs show some kind of diathesis). Consider for example the verb *wehen* 'to blow'. Such 'weather' verbs are often considered to have zero valency, which in German is characterised by an obligatory *es* pronoun \Next[a]. However, the same verb can just as well be used as an intransitive \Next[b,c], as a transitive with an accusative object \Next[d], or even as a ditransitive with a dative and accusative object \Next[e]. Note that the prepositional phrase in \Next[c,d,e] cannot be left out, and its obligatory presence might be used to argue for argument-status of these prepositional phrases. The example in \Next[e] then will be an example of the verb *wehen* with a valency of four.

\ex.
 \a. Heute weht es.
 \b. Gester wehte kein Lüftchen.
 \c. Der Rosenduft weht ins Zimmer.
 \d. Der Sturm weht den Schnee von den Dächern.
 \e. Der Fahrtwind weht mir die Mütze vom Kopf.

There is a recurrent tendency in the literature to try and reduce such variation to a single valency per verb (viz. its 'real' or 'underlying' valency), and various strategies are employed to arrive at such a prototypical valency [see e.g. @welke2011: Ch. 9 for a survey]. That will not be the approach taken here. Instead, valency is proposed to be a characteristic of a specific utterance, not of a specific verb. So, the examples in \Last can simple be assigned an \textsc{utterance valency} from zero \Last[a] to four \Last[e] even though they all use the same lexeme *wehen* as their main verb. 

As a replacement of the traditional lexeme-specific notion of valency (i.e. *geben* is ditransitive), I propose to use the notion of lexeme-specific lexical roles. Lexical roles are participants that are treated as an argument in at least one of the possible diatheses of a verb (see [@sec:intro-lexical-roles] for the proper definition).

Additionally, it is of course possible to define a notion of \textsc{lexeme valency}, for example as the collection of all attested utterance valencies for a specific lexeme. To be precise, the lexeme valency is properly defined as the collection of all utterance valencies, together with an indexation of the lexical roles across all arguments. This addition is important to distinguish between, for example, the lexical valency of *kochen* 'to cook' \Next and *essen* 'to eat' \NNext. Both can occur with a transitive and intransitive utterance valency, but the lexical roles that can be used in the intransitive differ. Specifically, the patient-role of *essen* cannot be used as nominative subject in the intransitive \NNext[c], different from *kochen* \Next[c]. In effect, these verbs have a different lexical valency.

\ex.
 \a. Der Chef kocht den Fond.
 \b. Der Chef kocht immer noch.
 \c. Der Fond kocht immer noch.

\ex.
 \a.    Der Chef isst den Fond.
 \b.    Der Chef isst immer noch.
 \c. \* Der Fond isst immer noch.

### Arguments of utterance valency {#sec:intro-arguments-utterance-valency}

There are different kinds of utterance-valency arguments. First, all case marked noun phrase constituents are arguments, with a few exceptions that will be discussed in [@sec:case-delimiting-arguments]. Basically, case marked arguments \Next[a] can be questioned by question pronouns *wer* or *was*, including their case forms *wem*, *wen* and *wessen* \Next[b,c]. Further, they can be pronominalised by personal pronouns \Next[d] or indefine pronouns *(irgend)jemand* or *(irgend)etwas* \Next[e].

\ex.
 \a. Der Löwe sieht einen Vogel.
 \b. Wer sieht einen Vogel?
 \c. Was sieht der Löwe?
 \d. Er sieht ihn.
 \e. Jemand sieht etwas.

Second, prepositional phrases \Next[a] are arguments of an utterance when they can be replaced by a complement clause of the form *da(r)+preposition, dass ...* \Next[b]. All details of the difficult question when to treat such governed prepositional phrases as arguments are discussed in [@sec:prepositions-delimiting-governed-prepositional-phrases].

\ex.
 \a. Der Weltreisende wartet auf einen Zug.
 \b. Der Weltreisende wartet darauf, dass ein Zug kommt.

Third, there exist obligatory prepositional phrases, though they are not very widespread in German and mostly designate a location. Some verbs always expect such a location-role, like *sich befinden* 'to be located somewhere' \Next[a,b], see e.g. [@sec:prepositions-obligatory-local; @sec:reflexive-obligatory-local], but more widespread are resultative diatheses that introduce an obligatory local role, like with *brechen* 'to break' \Next[c,d], see e.g. [@sec:prepositions-action-result]. The example in \Next[c] crucially shows that arguments should be determined as part of the clause structure, not the lexeme structure. It is perfectly possible to use the verb *brechen* without a prepositional phrase \Next[e], but then there needs to be a different lexical role in the accusative.

\ex.
 \a.    Der Stuhl befindet sich im Wohnzimmer
 \b. \* Der Stuhl befindet sich.
 \c.    Ich breche ein Loch in den Felsen.
 \d. \* Ich breche ein Loch.
 \e.    Ich breche den Felsen.

Finally, all complement clauses are arguments \Next[a,b], see Chapter [-@sec:subordination]. Complement clauses can be questioned by *was* \Next[c] and pronominalised by a definite pronoun *es* \Next[d] or an indefinite pronoun *(irgend)etwas* \Next[e]. Complement clauses are thus syntactically highly similar to case marked noun phrases. Caution should be taken when interpreting pronominalised examples like \Next[d,e], because it is not immediately obvious whether the pronouns are replacing a case-marked noun phrase or a complement clause. For example, with the verb *hoffen* \Next[e] it is not possible to replace the pronoun *es* with a noun phrase, though a governed prepositional phrase with *auf* is possible \Next[f].

\ex.
 \a. Er hofft, dass er rechtzeitig kommt.
 \b. Er hofft rechtzeitig zu kommen.
 \c. Was hofft er?
 \d. Er hofft es.
 \e. \* Er hofft eine gute Note.
 \f. Er hofft auf eine gute Note.

### *es* Arguments

A further kind of utterance-valency argument can be instantiated by *es*, the 3rd person nominative/accusative pronoun in the neutrum gender. There are various uses of this pronoun that have to be distinguished. In the first three uses the pronouns *es* des not have argument-status (viz. phoric, correlative and position-simulating *es*). Only the fourth usage of *es* will be counted as an argument (viz. valency-simulating *es*). 

First, *es* can be used for anaphoric reference to neutrum nouns, as shown in \Next. There are various other variants of such \textsc{phoric} usage, for example it also occurs without direct gender agreement [@czicza2014: Ch. 2]. 

\ex. Das Mädchen weint. Ich tröste es.

Second, another kind of referential *es* occurs with some non-finite complement clauses. By definition, a complement clause replaces an argument \Next[a], but in some cases a pronoun *es* remains in place of the original argument, side by side with the complement clause \Next[b]. This is known as a \textsc{correlative} *es* [@czicza2014: 79ff.].

\ex.
 \a. Ich vergesse [meine Aufgaben]. Ich vergesse [schnell zu laufen].
 \b. Ich hasse [meine Aufgaben]. Ich hasse es [schnell zu laufen].

Third, the pronoun *es* is also used to fill the first sentence position in front of the finite verb ('Vorfeld' in German grammatical terminology), because there is a strong regularity in German that this position can not be left empty (except in imperatives and in yes/no questions). Word order is rather flexible in German, and it is often possible to have no lexical content in the Vorfeld. In such sentences, the pronoun *es* has to be used to fill the Vorfeld, as shown in \Next[b]. This is known as a \textsc{position-simulating} *es* [@czicza2014: 115].

\ex. 
 \a. Es weint ein Mädchen.
 \b. Ein Mädchen weint. 

Finally, there are also constructions that obligatorily include the pronoun *es* in the sentence as part of the valency of the utterance. The main reason for such an *es* is that there is a strong regularity in German that a nominative subject has to be present in each sentence (with very few exceptions, see below). Note that 'subject' is defined here for German as the nominative noun phrase that shows agreement with the finite verb. When there is no subject available, then the pronoun *es* is used to fill this gap. This is known as a \textsc{valency-simulating} *es* [@czicza2014: 115]. In the analysis of diatheses in this book, such valency-simulating *es* is not explicitly noted. Any clause without an "N"-marked argument induces a valency-simulating *es* (with very few exceptions, as noted below).

In constructions with a valency-simulating *es*, as exemplified in \Next[a,b], the pronoun *es* can occur in the Vorfeld \Next[a], seemingly parallel to the position-simulating usage \Last[a]. However, When another constituent is placed in the Vorfeld, this obligatory *es* in \Next[a] cannot be removed, but has to occur elsewhere in the sentence, typically immediately after the finite verb \Next[b]. 

\ex.
 \a. Es stinkt hier sehr.
 \b. Hier stinkt es sehr.

In a very limited set of constructions, a valency-simulating *es* is left out, resulting in sentences without any formal nominative subject \Next. Most of these cases are historical idiosyncrasies, except for the impersonal passive \Next[d], see [@sec:participles-werden-impersonal-passive].

\ex.
 \a. Heute ist mir kalt.
 \b. Dem Arzt graut vor Blut.
 \c. Mir liegt viel an deiner Anwesenheit.
 \d. Jetzt wird geschlafen!

There are also a few rare cases in which there is a valency-simulating *es* in what appears to be an accusative case \Next.

\ex.
 \a. Ich habe es auf ihn abgesehen. (see [@sec:prepositions-nominative-es-preposition])
 \b. Wir haben es gut. (see [@sec:adverbials-accusative-es])

### Adjuncts

Adjuncts, the counterparts of arguments, are phrases that are not specifically induced by the main verb of a clause. Typically, such adjuncts are adverbial prepositional phrases, see [@sec:prepositions-definition-non-governed]. Just like with arguments, adjunct status should not be linked to a lexical verb itself, but to the clause construction in which it is used. For example, the verb *tanzen* 'to dance' is typically considered to be an intransitive verb with optional (adjunct) locational prepositional phrases \Next[a,b]. However, there is a crucial difference between these two locations, see [@sec:prepositions-manner-of-movement]. The static location *im Saal* 'in the hall' \Next[a] remains optional in the perfect (with auxiliary *haben*), see \Next[c,d], while the dynamic location *in den Saal* 'into the hall' becomes obligatory in the perfect (with auxiliary *sein*), see \Next[e,f]. So, the obligatory location in \Next[e] is an utterance argument (and as a consequence, the role of 'path' is a lexical role of such verbs of movement like *tanzen*).

\ex.
 \a. Ich tanze (im Saal).
 \b. Ich tanze (durch den Saal).
 \c. Ich habe im Saal getanzt.
 \d. Ich habe getanzt.
 \e. Ich bin durch den Saal getanzt.
 \f. \* Ich bin getanzt.

Adjuncts are, by definition, optionally present, so there is a natural connection to zero expression. A central problem here is whether there is a crucial distinction between constructions in which a participant is obligatorily absent (i.e. impossible to express) vs. optionally absent (i.e. possibly not expressed). In most diatheses that involve absence, the whole point is that there is an alternation between absence and presence of a lexical role (e.g. in all drop and addition diatheses). The problematic cases are differences like passive vs. anticausative, which by definition are distinguished by possibility vs. impossibility for the agent to be expressed. This difference is highly volatile (i.e. it often differs from lexeme to lexeme whether it is possible or just dispreferred for an agent to be expressed).

## Voice

### Formal marking of diathesis

classification of grammatical form ('voice'): different chapters of this book!

The actual linguistic marking of the diathesis (for example by verbal morphology or auxiliaries) is called 'grammatical voice' in Zuñiga & Kittilä [-@zuniga2019: 4]

### Stacking of diatheses

Different diatheses can be applied one after the other, forming \textsc{stacks} of diatheses. Such stacked diatheses can lead to extremely complicated

## Diathetical operations

### Abbreviations used

A diathetical operation is change that happens in the marking of the participants in a diathesis. One of the central definitional properties of a diathesis is that the coding of at least one of the participants has to change, e.g. a participant erstwhile coded with an accusative turns into a prepositional phrase. Because the role of the participant remains the same (again, by definition), such a change amounts to the mapping of a role onto a different grammatical form. I will call this process \textsc{role-remapping}.

In the analysis of diathetical operations in this book I will use the following abbreviations, as summarised in [@fig:abbreviations]. First, \textsc{grammatical expressions}, i.e. actual grammatical forms as identified in traditional German grammar, are abbreviated with single letters, shown at the right side of the figure. For case-marked noun phrases I will use the easily recognizable capital letters 'NADG' for nominative, accusative, dative and genitive respectively. As argued earlier (see [@sec:intro-arguments-utterance-valency]) there are also prepositional phrases that express lexically-determined roles. These will also be abbreviated with capital letters: 'L' for obligatory locations and 'P' for governed prepositional phrases.

![Abbreviations used to describe role-remapping](figures/abbreviations.pdf){#fig:abbreviations}

Lower-cased letters are used for non-argument participants in the clause: 'p' for non-governed prepositional phrases and 'g' for adnominal genitives. Absence of a specific role with be indicated by a '–' dash. Lower-cased 'a' and 'd' are only used in [@sec:reflexive-no-diathesis] to indicate accusative and dative reflexive pronouns in referential usage. As described in much detail in that chapter, it is important to distinguish between reflexive pronouns in German that refer to a lexical role (i.e. 'referential' or 'real' reflexive constructions) and reflexive pronouns that mark a diathesis without referring to a role themselves. Those latter reflexive pronouns are not marking any roles, so they are not abbreviated by lowercased 'a' or 'd'.

Besides single-letter abbreviations I will also use capitalised three-letter abbreviations for a more abstract level of analysis. As summarised at the left side of [@fig:abbreviations], the grammatical expressions are grouped into sets of \textsc{grammatical macroroles}, mostly along familiar lines. This grouping is not necessarily the best or most optimal grouping, but this grouping has emerged to be useful to organise the large diversity of diatheses in this book. The notion \textsc{subject} (SBJ) is used for governed nominative phrases. There are various other nominatively-marked phrases in German grammar which are not included here (e.g. in nominal or equational predication like *der Täter* in *Er ist der Täter*). The other case-marked governed phrases are combined as \textsc{cased objects} (OBJ). Together with the \textsc{prepositional objects} (PBJ) they form a superclass of objects. Non-governed phrases are separated in \textsc{overtly expressed adjuncts} (ADJ) and unexpressed roles (Ø).

It is imperative to realise that the macroroles are defined in a language-specific way for German grammar as groupings of language-specific German expressions (e.g. ADJ is defined as being either a non-governed prepositional phrase or an adnominal genitive). The names that are used (e.g. 'object' or 'adjunct') deliberately conjure up general cross-linguistic associations, but it remains to be seen whether similar definitions as used here are also useful for other languages. I will refrain from any cross-linguistic speculation in this context here.

### Remapping of roles

Using the abbreviations as summarised in [@fig:abbreviations] I will organise and categorise the role-remapping of all diatheses in various levels of abstraction. These different categorisations inform the practical organisation of each chapter.

**Level 1: Diathesis**. Each diathesis is summarised in its own subsubsection. The establishment of an individual diathesis is not always obvious, and each diathesis in this book is already an conscious categorisation (which could be wrong). It has actually been a voyage of discovery in the preparation of this book to decide when to consider a set of examples to be a single diathesis. Very often erstwhile single diatheses turned out to be better analysed by a split into various different diatheses. Although I am rather confident in the quality of the current decisions, I expect that further refinements are necessary in the future.

**Level 2: Remapping Pattern**. The role-remapping of each diathesis is analysed using the single-letter abbreviations (NADGPLpgad–) from [@fig:abbreviations]. A remapping is specified as an ordered listing of grammatical expressions for roles, both before and after the diathesis. For example, [ NA | –N ] is a diathesis that involves two roles that are marked 'NA' before the diathesis and '–N' after the diathesis. Because there are many diatheses with this same pattern, this characterisation is already an (implicit) classification.

**Level 3: Local Group**. Groups of diatheses with similar semantics within each chapter are grouped together as a local group. These groups are rather ad-hoc and mainly represent a convenience-summary to streamline the presentation. Local groups are unnumbered subsections, indicated graphically with dashes around the name of the local group.

**Level 4: Macrorole Pattern**. The remapping of each local group is structurally analysed in terms of the three-letter macroroles (SBJ, OBJ, PBJ, ADJ, Ø) from [@fig:abbreviations]. For example, the remapping from above [ NA | –N ] includes both a change from N to zero (i.e. SBJ > Ø) and a change from A to N (i.e. OBJ > SBJ). These two macrorole changes can be combined into a single macrorole patter [\ OBJ\ >\ SBJ\ >\ Ø\ ].

**Level 5: Promotion/Demotion**. On the most abstract level, all diatheses are separated into subsections of either demotion or promotion (with only very few diatheses being symmetrical exchanges). Basically, each remapping is evaluated on the macrorole hierarchy \Next with role-remapping upwards being promotion and role-remapping downward being demotion. Note that there is a crucial additional criterion necessary, because the majority of diatheses consist of two coinciding remappings (see [@sec:intro-chaining]). In such remappings, the largest jump on the macrorole hierarchy defines a diathesis as being demotion or promotion.

\ex. Macrorole Hierarchy: SBJ >> OBJ >> PBJ >> ADJ >> Ø 

For example, the diathesis in \Next will be analysed as a \textsc{remapping pattern} [\ NA\ |\ –N\ ], see [@sec:reflexive-anticausative]. This should be read as follows: there is an alternation between a clause with 'NA' arguments (nominative, accusative) and a clause with only 'N' marking (nominative). The relative order of these letters is crucial, as the order of the roles remains fixed in this notation, e.g. the second letter on the left 'A' (accusative) corresponds to the second letter on the right 'N' (nominative). The '–' dash on the right indicates that the corresponding 'N' on the left is not expressed. Note that the actual linear arrangement of the letters is flexible, as long as both sides of the alternation remain in the same order, i.e. [\ AN\ |\ N–\ ] would be the same remapping pattern. The remapping pattern [\ NA\ |\ –N\ ] is an implicit categorisation, because there are many other diatheses that have exactly the same pattern (e.g. see [@sec:case-haben-anticausative; @sec:adverbial-reflexive-transitive-anticausative; @sec:participles-sein-zustandspassiv]).

\ex.
 \a. Ich schließe die Tür.
 \b. Die Tür schließt sich. 

Although there is a reflexive pronoun in \Last[b], this pronoun is not included with a lower-cased 'a' in the remapping pattern [\ NA\ |\ –N\ ], because this reflexive pronoun does not refer to a separate role. The verb *schließen* 'to close' implies at least two different roles, the 'closer' and the 'closed object', expressed as nominative and accusative in \Last[a], respectively. In \Last[b] only the role of 'closed object' is expressed as nominative. The reflexive pronoun does not refer to any other role.

I interpret the reflexive pronoun in \Last as a marker of the diathesis itself (see Chapter [-@sec:reflexive] for an extensive discussion), so there is an overt direction in the markedness from \Last[a] to \Last[b]. The '|' bar in the middle of the remapping pattern [\ NA\ |\ –N\ ] implies this direction in markedness, i.e. left side describes the unmarked alternant and the right the marked alternant. Reordering the remapping pattern would result in a completely reversed diathesis [\ –N\ |\ NA\ ].

The diathesis in \Last is one of various examples of a \textsc{local group} called 'reflexive antipassive'. Other diatheses in this group include examples like \Next with an additional governed preposition, analysed with the remapping pattern [\ NAP\ |\ –NP\ ], see [@sec:reflexive-anticausative-governed-preposition]. All diatheses in this local group have the same \textsc{macrorole pattern}, namely [\ OBJ\ >\ SBJ\ >\ Ø\ ], i.e a cased object is turned into nominative subject, which is turned into zero (i.e. unexpressed).

This diathesis is a combination of two different remappings (OBJ>SBJ and SBJ>Ø), with the first being a promotion on the macrorole hierarchy and the second a demotion. However, because the second remapping (SBJ>Ø) is a larger jump on the hierarchy, the complete combination is categorised as a \textsc{demotion}.

\ex.
 \a. Das Lied erinnert den Mann an den Krieg.
 \b. Der Mann erinnert sich an den Krieg.

So, in summary, the role-remapping in the diathesis \Last is categorised as:

1. **Diathesis**: Reflexive antipassive + governed preposition
2. **Remapping Pattern**: [\ NAP\ |\ –NP\ ]
3. **Local Group**: Reflexive antipassive
4. **Macrorole Pattern**: [\ OBJ\ >\ SBJ\ >\ Ø\ ]
5. **Promotion/Demotion**: Demotion

## Chaining {#sec:intro-chaining}

### Isolated diatheses

Many diatheses just remap a single role. Such sole diatheses are called \textsc{isolated diatheses} here. However, there are also many diatheses in which more than one role is remapped. I distinguish the following kinds of role-remappings, of which only the first two are frequently attested.

- **Isolated Diathesis**: One role changes its formal marking.
- **Chained Diathesis**: Two roles change their formal marking, forming a chain in which one role changes its form from X to Y, while the other role changes its form from Y to Z.
- **Multi-chained Diathesis**: More than two roles change their formal marking, forming a longer chain of connected changes.
- **Disjunct Diathesis**: Two (or more) roles change their formal marking, with no overlap between marking.

### Chained diatheses

When two roles are remapped by a single diathesis it is surprisingly frequent for them to be chained. In a \textsc{chained diathesis} the resulting form of one remapping is the start of the second. This can be conceptualised as a 'push' chain in which one remapping induces another because German grammar strongly disprefers multiple constituents of the same kind (e.g. two accusatives) in the same clause.

Chained diatheses typically occur when the nominative subject is involved in the diathesis. There can only be a single nominative subject in a German clause, and it is highly unusual to have a sentene without a nominative subject. This implies that any diathesis involving the nominative subject typically includes two remappings, namely one from something else to nominative and a second remapping of the erstwhile nominative to something else.

A prototypical example of a chained diathesis involving the nominative subject is the *werden* passive \Next. Here, the erstwhile accusative *Kuchen* 'cake' is turned into a nominative, while the erstwhile nominative *Lehrling* 'apprentice' is removed (or optionally retained as a *von* prepositional phrase). So, we have a chain consisting of the role-remappings [OBJ>SBJ] and [SBJ>ADJ].

\ex. [ OBJ > SBJ > ADJ ]
 \a. Der Lehrling backt den Kuchen.
 \b. Der Kuchen wird gebacken (von den Lehrling).

Diatheses without involvement of the nominative subject are more flexible, in that both isolated and chained diatheses are common. A typical example of a chained diathesis is a full applicative induces by the preverb *be-* \Next. In this example, a prepositional phrase *für ihre Freundin* 'for her friend' is remapped to an accusative [ADJ>OBJ] while the erstwhile accusative *Essen* 'food' is turned into a prepositional phrase [OBJ>ADJ].

\ex. [ ADJ > OBJ > ADJ ]
 \a. Sie kochte kubanisches Essen für ihre Freundin.
 \b. Sie bekocht ihre Freundin mit kubanischem Essen.

Among chained diatheses there is a group of frequently recurring remapping patterns. Because of their frequency, it is highly useful to give them specific names. Such names are widespread in the literature, e.g. anticausative for [OBJ>SBJ>Ø] or passive for [OBJ>SBJ>ADJ]. A survey of the various names used in this book (and all confusion surrounding them in the literature) will be pursued in [@sec:intro-naming].

### Multi-chained diatheses

\textsc{multi-chained diatheses} consist of combinations of more than two role-remappings that occur in a sequence. This occurs frequently as the result of a stack of multiple diatheses, but only very rarely in a single diathesis. As an example arising from a stack of multiple diatheses consider taking a verb like *lesen* 'to read' \Next[a] and applying a stack of two diatheses \Next[b,c]. This leads to a chain of three role-remappings. First, the preverb diathesis with *vor-* \Next[b] leads to the addition of a dative argument *dem Jungen*, i.e. a role-remapping [Ø>OBJ], see [@sec:preverb-dative-additions]. On top of that, the *bekommen* dative passive \Next[c] promotes this dative to subject and removes the original subject, i.e. a role-remapping [OBJ>SBJ>Ø], see [@sec:participles-bekommen-passive]. Combined, these two diatheses lead to a role-remapping [Ø>OBJ>SBJ>Ø].

\ex. [ Ø > OBJ > SBJ > Ø ]\
 \a. Der Vater hat ein Buch gelesen.
 \b. Der Vater hat dem Jungen ein Buch vorgelesene.
 \c. Der Junge bekommt ein Buch vorgelesen.

Such multi-chained diatheses resulting from diathesis-stacking are widespread. However, I know of only two diatheses with a multi-chain that cannot be decomposed into a stack of separate diatheses. Both these 'fixed' multi-chain diatheses appear to occur with just a few idiosyncratic verbs, so this phenomenon really seems to be dispreferred in German.

First, the preverb diathesis from *erben* 'to inherit' to *enterben* 'to disinherit' \Next, see [@sec:preverb-inverted-passive-accusative-loss], contains three linked role-remappings for the roles of (i) the originator of the inheritance *Vater* 'father' [ADJ>SBJ], (ii) the receiver of the inheritance *Junge* 'boy' [SBJ>OBJ] and (iii) the inheritance *Schreibtisch* 'desk' [OBJ>Ø].

\ex. [ ADJ > SBJ > OBJ > Ø ]\
 \a. Der Junge erbt den Schreibtisch von seinem Vater.
 \b. Sein Vater enterbt den Jungen.

Second, the verb *schmecken* 'to taste' \Next, see [@sec:prepositions-ingredient-anticausative], allows for two different constructions with three linked role-remappings for (i) the tasted substance *Pfefferminze* 'peppermint' [OBJ>ADJ], (ii) the tasted dish *Suppe* 'soup' [ADJ>SBJ] and (iii) the taster *Koch* 'cook' [SBJ>Ø].

\ex. [ OBJ > ADJ > SBJ > Ø ]\ 
 \a. Der Koch schmeckt die Pfefferminze in der Suppe.
 \b. Die Suppe schmeckt nach Pfefferminze

### Disjunct diatheses

\textsc{disjunct diatheses} consiste of a combination of multiple role-remappings that are not linked to each other. Just as with the multi-chained diatheses from the previous section, disjunct diatheses regularly occur as the result of stacking of diatheses. In constrast, they are very rare in individual diatheses.

When multiple diatheses are stacked, i.e. whey they are applied sequentially on top of each other, they are often structurally independent. For example, the verb *waschen* 'to wash' \Next[a] can be used in a resultative construction \Next[b] in which the role of washee *Hemd* 'shirt' is turned from an accusative into a location (OBJ>PBJ) and a new accusative object is introduced for the role of the result *Fleck* 'stain' (Ø>OBJ), see [@sec:prepositions-action-result]. Independent of this chained diathesis, the possessor of the object *Nachbar* 'neighbour' can be raised to genitive \Next[c], see [@sec:prepositions-possessor-of-location-to-dative-experiencer-accusative].

\ex. [ Ø > OBJ > PBJ, ADJ > OBJ ]
 \a. Ich wasche das Hemd des Nachbarn.
 \b. Ich wasche den Fleck aus dem Hemd des Nachbarn.
 \c. Ich wasche dem Nachbarn den Fleck aus dem Hemd.

There are only a few incidental examples uf such disjunct diatheses without stacking. The following four examples all only occur with a very limited number of verbs. First, the verb *deuten* can be used both the mean 'interpret' \Next[a] and 'forebode' \Next[b] with a rather transparent connection between the two. However, the role-remappings are quite complex, see [@sec:prepositions-anticausative-preposition-addition].

\ex. [ Ø > PBJ, OBJ > SBJ > Ø]
 \a. Ich deute den Traum. 
 \b. Der Traum deutet auf nichts Gutes. 

Second, some preverbs lead to disjunct diatheses, like with *schweigen* 'to remain silent' and *verschweigen* 'to conceal' \Next, see [@sec:preverb-double-applicative].

\ex. [ ADJ > OBJ, PBJ > OBJ]
 \a. Ich schweige zu dir über meinen Besuch.
 \b. Ich verschweige dir meinen Besuch.

Further examples are resultatives for a few verbs of naming like *schimpfen* 'to scold' \Next, see [@sec:prepositions-naming-result]. The disjunct diathesis in \NNext is less clear, as it might be better analysed as a stack, see [@sec:prepositions-nominative-demotion-dative-addition].

\ex. [ Ø > OBJ, ADJ > OBJ]
 \a. Sie schimpft auf mich.
 \b. Sie schimpft mich einen Narren

\ex. [ Ø > OBJ, SBJ > ADJ]
 \a. Der Sommer ist kalt.
 \b. Mir ist kalt im Sommer.

The only somewhat more widespread disjunct diathesis is the resultative construction that can arise with some apparently intransitive verbs like *schwitzen* 'to sweat' \Next. This diathesis introduces two roles at once: a result *Fleck* 'stain' and an obligatory location *Hemd* 'shirt', see [@sec:prepositions-intransitive-location-as-result].

\ex. [ Ø > OBJ, Ø > PBJ ]
 \a. Ich schwitze.
 \b. Ich schwitze einen Fleck in meinem Hemd.

## Naming {#sec:intro-naming}

### Terminological confusion

The different kinds of diatheses distinguished here have a long history in the typological literature [cf. @melcuk1993; @wunderlich1993; @wunderlich2015; @dixon2000a; @dixon2014; @haspelmath2004c; @kulikov2011; @malchukov2015: 96ff.; @zuniga2019]

First use of "antipassive": [@silverstein1972: 395], known as 'deaccusative' [@geniusiene1987: 94] and antiapplicative [@haspelmath2004c: 1132]

drop is named "antipassive" in [@scheibl2006: 372-373] and antipassive is called 'antiapplicative' [@scheibl2006: 371]

In the discussion of the various diatheses in German, I will classify them into different kinds of diatheses. This classification is not a definitional issue, but purely a practical organisational device. It might very well turn out that some of these classifications is not ideal, i.e. that some alternation is better considered as belonging to a different kind. However, such a reorganisation would not change anything about the diatheses themselves.

### Diatheses involving the subject

- **ANTICAUSATIVE: Removal of a causer from subject.** The typical characteristic of an anticausative is the removal of the nominative subject which causes the action/state of the clause. Filling the gap, any non-nominative argument is promoted to subject. Note that in effect, such an alternation is highly similar to a passive. The main difference (which is often difficult to decide) is that for a passive the original subject is still implied (and can be overtly expressed), while for an anticausative the original subject is completely removed (e.g. a phrase like "by itself" can typically be added).
- **PASSIVE: Promotion of a non-nominative argument to subject.** The typical characteristic of a passive is a non-nominatively case-marked role to being 'more important', typically becoming the subject (i.e. nominative + verb agreement). The original subject can optionally be retained as an non-nominative case or a prepositional phrase. In general, the original subject is still understood to be some kind of agent in the passive alternant.
- **FABRICATIVE**
- **CONCILIATIVE**
- **REVERSED CONCILIATIVE???**

- **NOVATIVE: Addition of a new causer as subject.** The typical characteristic of a causative is the addition of a new nominative subject which causes the action/state as described in the original clause. The original nominative is typically retained as a non-nominative argument. There are many similar diathesis in which the new nominative is not a causer: benefactive (haben+am+INF), experientive (sehen+INF), permissive (lassen+INF).
- **REVERSED PASSIVE** "Causative with extended demotion" [@kulikov2011: 388]
- **REVERSED FABRICATIVE**

- **INVERSIVE: subject and object switch.** [@malchukov2015: 99-100], "symmetric conversive" [@kulikov2011: 380]
- **CONVERSIVE** [@kulikov2011: 380]
- **REVERSED CONVERSIVE**

- **COMMUTATIVE**

### Diatheses without involvement of the subject

- **APPLICATIVE: Addition of a new non-nominative argument.** The typical characteristic of an applicative is the introduction of a new non-nominatively marked role. Typically, a new role is marked as an accusative and the original accusatively marked role is encoded differently. It is also possible that the new role is not replacing any existing marking, but simply added to the argument structure of a verb. However, I will classify such completely new roles mostly as an **addition** of an argument.
- **ANTIAPPLICATIVE (ANTIPASSIVE): Demotion of a non-nominative argument to prepositional phrase.** The typical characteristic of an antipassive is a non-nominatively case-marked role to being marked as 'less important', typically becoming a prepositional phrase. The complete removal of this role can be seen as an extreme form of an antipassive, though I mostly classify such a removal separately as a **drop** of an argument.

- **RESULTATIVE: Addtion of a new causee as a non-nominative argument.** The typical characteristic of a resultative is the addition of a new causee. Instead of simply expressing the content of a predicate as the action/state of the clause, a resultative diatheses expressed that something is caused by performing the predicate. Note that the term "resultative" is used by [@nedjalkov1988a] with a different meaning (viz. a special kind of anticausative)
- **ANTIRESULTATIVE**
- **POSSESSOR RAISING: possessor of an argument becomes a separate argument.**

- **DROP** "deobjective" [@haspelmath2004c: 1131]
- **ADDITION**
