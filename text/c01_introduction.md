# Setting the scene {#sec:intro}

## The daunting diversity of diathesis

The quintessential example of German diathesis, discussed in every grammatical description of this language, is the *werden+Partizip* passive construction [@next a]. The crucial characteristic that makes this a diathesis is that the state-of-affairs as described by the passive is fundamentally the same as in the corresponding active [@next b]. Yet, while the circumstances remains the same, the grammatical structure and the communicated perspective differ between the two expressions.

::: ex
a. Das Gemälde wird von einem Künstler gemalt.
b. Der Künstler malt ein Gemälde.
:::

This general approach to diathesis, viz. alternating sentence structures that express approximately the same state-of-affairs, is applicable to a large number of grammatical phenomena in German. All in all, almost 250 different German diatheses are described in this book, some highly productive, some only attested for a handful of verbs. The main goal of this book is to present this wealth of grammatical possibility in a unified manner, while at the same time attempting to classify and organise this diversity.^[I will make no attempt to fit all the hundreds of constructional possibilities of the German language into any specific grammatical framework, although the collection of diatheses presented here might be taken as a modelling-challenge for your favourite grammatical theory.]

It might come as a surprise that there are so many different diatheses in German, but my impression is that in this respect German is no exception among the world's languages. I expect that all languages have a similar abundance of different ways in which to construe a sentence around a lexical predicate. In a sense, a diathesis allows for the expression of a distinct perspective on the event described, something that is arguably a common desire of any language user.

By way of an introduction, consider the following five illustrative examples of diathesis.^[Many examples in this book contain masculine nouns, not because of laziness on my behalf, but because their definite articles overtly show the different German cases (*der, des, dem, den*). Notwithstanding this grammatical preference, I will try to use examples with as much diversity as possible throughout this book.] Some verbs, like *beginnen* 'to start' [@next a], allow for a passive-like constructions without any *werden* auxiliary, often called 'anticausative'. Other verbs, like *schießen* 'to shoot' [@next b], allow for an alternation between an accusative and a prepositional phrase, often called 'antipassive'. Further, there are many different kinds of diathesis marked by a reflexive pronoun, like the reflexive antipassive with *beklagen* 'to lament' [@next c]. Diathesis is also frequently marked by a prefix, like the applicative between *stammen aus* and *entstammen* 'to descend from' [@next d]. Lastly, many light-verb constructions show diathesis, for example the *sein+zu‑In­fi­ni­tiv* passive, as illustrated below with the main verb *lösen* 'to solve [@next e].

## Defining diathesis {#sec:intro-basic-definition}

A diathesis is defined here as special kind of alternation between two different clause constructions. To properly define diathesis, I will first define 'alternation' in general. The definition of 'clause alternation' will then be established on that basis. Finally, a diathesis will be defined as a special kind of clause alternation.

Hidden in these succinct definitions there are various grammatical concepts that will be expanded upon in the subsequent sections. The more general aspect of clause alternation are discussed in this chapter, directly below the following definitions, while the details of the analysis and classification of the different kinds of diathesis is postponed to the next chapter.

#### Alternation {.unnumbered}

An ~~alternation~~ (or simply 'grammatical marking') is defined as follows:

- An alternation consists of two different linguistic constructions, i.e. there are two alternants.
- Typically, the lexical root (or possibly a larger linguistic entity) does not change in the alternation, i.e. there is some fundamental linguistic material in both alternants that remains the same.
- Typically, the difference between these alternants is overtly indicated by the presence of some additional linguistic material.
- Typically, the overt marking introduces a direction into the alternation, i.e. one alternant consists of less/shorter/zero linguistic elements ('less marked') and one consists of more/longer/overt linguistic material ('more marked'). In some situations the direction of the alternation remains undecidable, i.e. the alternation is equipollent.
- The collection of roots (or possibly larger linguistic entities) to which the alternation applies creates an empirical linguistic class. Such an empirical class often has a semantic/functional interpretation, but not necessarily so.

Alternations include basic morphological oppositions, like singular vs. plural [@next a] and in general comprise any opposition of grammatical forms, like synthetic present vs. analytic perfect [@next b]. Alternations also exist in syntax as oppositions between different sentence structures, like a plain transitive nominative+accusative structure alternating with an intransitive reflexive anticausative with obligatory adverbial [@next c].

::: ex
a. Ein Haus. \
   Zwei Häuser.
b. Das Kind schläft. \
   Das Kind hat geschlafen.
c. Ich verkaufe das Buch. \
   Das Buch verkauft sich gut.
:::

There is a though-provoking and almost philosophical issue here, which I will not further explore, namely whether the basis of grammatical analysis are the constructions themselves or the alternations between constructions. The approach taken here is that the alternations are the more crucial entities. I consider alternations as the morphosyntactic equivalent to phonological minimal pairs. Alternations are also useful in the practice of grammatical description. The meaning/function of a construction by itself is often hard to describe in full, while the meaning/function of an alternation can simply be described by the difference in meaning between the alternants. Only the crucial facets that are added by the alternation need to be captured – a task that often is already difficult enough. Similar intuitions about the importance of alternations have led to the development of syntactic transformations [cf. @harris1957].

#### Clause alternation {.unnumbered}

Based on the above definition of an alternation, a ~~clause alternation~~ is defined as follows:

- In a clause alternation both alternants are monoclausal, i.e. both alternants contain a single main predicate. For German, the crucial definitional property of monoclausality will be a phenomenon called 'coherence' (see [@sec:intro-coherence]).
- In both alternants, the main predicate consists of the same lexeme, i.e both contain the same verb and the meaning of the lexical verb does not (substantially) change between the alternants (see [@sec:intro-lexical-meanings]).
- The lexical roles of the verb do not change between the alternants. Lexical roles are an inherent part of the meaning of a verb and alternations do not change them. Note, however, that there might be new roles introduced or some roles might be left unexpressed (see [@sec:intro-lexical-roles]).
- A specific clause alternation is only applicable to a restricted set of verbs. The list of applicable verbs constitutes the domain of application of the alternation. Any semantic/syntactic characterisation of these applicable verbs should be seen as a summary of the domain of application, not its definition (see [@sec:intro-domain-of-application]).
- The meaning/function of the whole clause changes between the alternants. This functional difference is the whole point of having a clause alternation in the first place (see [@sec:intro-functional-analysis]).

Clause alternations are widespread when auxiliaries are introduced, like modal *müssen* 'have to' [@next a], see [@sec:infinitive-modals]. However, clause alternations are attested with many more different kinds of marking, like the verb particle *auf‑* marking completeness of the action [@next b], see [@sec:prepositions-accusative-antipassive], or the somewhat mysterious 'free' reflexive *sich* with verbs like *ansehen* 'look at' [@next c], see [@sec:reflexive-free-dative-sich-accusative]. Arguably, the special word order in German subordinate clauses (viz. with the finite verb in clause-final position) can also be regarded as a clause alternation [@next d].

::: ex
a. Er erledigt seine Hausaufgaben. \
   Er muss seine Hausaufgaben erledigen.
b. Ich esse den Apfel. \
   Ich esse den Apfel auf.
c. Er hat das Haus angesehen. \
   Er hat sich das Haus angesehen.
d. Er erledigt seine Hausaufgaben. \
   (Ich hoffe, dass) er seine Hausaufgaben erledigt.
:::

#### Diathesis {.unnumbered}

Based on the notion of a clause alternation, a ~~diathesis~~ (sometimes also known as 'valency alternation') is defined as follows:

- A diathesis is a clause alternation in which at least one of the lexical roles has a different form between the clausal alternants, i.e. at least one of the roles is remapped to a different grammatical expression. In other words, a diathesis is a clause alternation with a co-occurring role-marking alternation (see [@sec:intro-diathetical-operations]). In opposition to diathesis, a clause alternation without any role remapping is called an ~~epithesis~~ (see Chapter [-@sec:epithesis]).
- Remapped roles do not substantially change their meaning, i.e. 'who does what to whom' does not change. However, the details of the relation between the main predicate and the remapped roles can (and normally will) change. For example, the role's influence on the action, or its affectedness by the predicate, might change. At the extreme, the remapping of a role can consist in the addition of a completely new role or in the complete removal of an existing role (see [@sec:intro-valency]).
- As is true for all alternations, a diathesis has a direction from a formally 'less marked' to a 'more marked' alternant. However, in some special instances a diathesis will have no overt marking other than the change in marking of the remapped roles itself. This will be called a covert (or equipollent, or bare) diathesis. The different ways of marking a diathesis will be the basic organisational structure of this book (see [@sec:intro-voice]).
- As a practical restriction, I will only consider diatheses in which one alternant is a basic clause with a single finite verb. In principle, when there is a diathesis between a basic clause and structure A, and another diathesis between the same basic clause and structure B, then there is also a diathesis between structures A and B. However, such diatheses are not included here. It is a major goal of this book to present a precise description of all possible role remappings relative to the basic clause structure (see [@sec:intro-naming]).

The prototypical example of a diathesis is the *werden+Partizip* passive as in [@next a], see [@sec:participles-werden-passive]. Also widely acknowledged is the *bekommen+Partizip* dative passive as shown in [@next b], see [@sec:participles-bekommen-passive]. However, the diversity of diatheses in German goes well beyond such light-verb constructions. There is also, for example, a passive-like diathesis marked with a reflexive pronoun as shown in [@next c], see [@sec:reflexive-preposition-passive], or an applicative diathesis marked with a prefix *be‑* as shown in [@next d], see [@sec:preverb-applicative].

## Definitional details

### Monoclausality and coherence {#sec:intro-coherence}

Diatheses are defined here as alternations between clauses with the same main verb. However, a single clause in German can contain multiple verb forms, for example when auxiliaries are used. It is crucial to strictly distinguish between expressions in which a multi-verb construction is monoclausal and when it is not. Only monoclausal constructions will be considered in this book.

To define monoclausality, I will use the fact that the finite verb in German is placed at the end of a subordinate clause. The dummy main sentence *Es ist bekannt, dass* 'it is known that' will be used to force such a subordinate construction. The position of the finite verb in the subordinate clause can then be used to identify the boundary of the clause. Concretely, everything that can occur before the finite verb still belongs within the clause. In contrast, everything that has to come after the finite verb belongs to a different clause. For example, the sentence in [@next a] will turn into [@next b] in a subordinate construction. The finite verbform *gehe* now occurs at the end of the sentence. In this example it is not possible for anything to follow after this finite verb, as shown by the ungrammaticality of [@next c]. So, the original sentence in [@next a] is a single clause. 

::: ex
a. Ich gehe morgen nach Hause.
b. (Es ist bekannt, dass) ich morgen nach Hause gehe.
c. ^* (Es ist bekannt, dass) ich gehe morgen nach Hause.
:::

Sentences with this characteristic will be called (syntactically) ~~coherent~~, following Bech [-@bech1955; see also @kiss1995 for an in-depth discussion].^[This usage of the term 'coherence' is slightly confusing, because it is used here as a technical term from the syntactic literature, completely independent from the pragmatic usage of the term 'coherence' for contextual interconnectedness.] Coherent constructions are considered to be monoclausal. For example, coherence is attested in auxiliary constructions with participles [@next] and infinitives [@nnext]. Such constructions are thus monoclausal.

::: ex
a. Ich habe gestern ein Haus gekauft.
b. (Es ist bekannt, dass) ich gestern ein Haus gekauft habe.
c. ^* (Es ist bekannt, dass) ich gestern gekauft habe ein Haus.
:::

::: ex
a. Ich will morgen ein Haus kaufen.
b. (Es ist bekannt, dass) ich morgen ein Haus kaufen will.
c. ^* (Es ist bekannt, dass) ich morgen kaufen will ein Haus.
:::

In contrast, constructions with *zu* and an infinitive are sometimes coherent, e.g. [@next] with the finite verb *geben* 'to give', and sometimes non-coherent, e.g. [@nnext] with the finite verb *behaupten* 'to claim'. The coherent construction in [@next a] is thus monoclausal, while the non-coherent construction in [@nnext a] consists of two clauses.

::: ex
a. Der Protest gibt ihr zu denken.
b. (Es ist bekannt, dass) der Protest ihr zu denken gibt.
c. ^* (Es ist bekannt, dass) der Protest gibt ihr zu denken.
:::

::: ex
a. Der Sportler behauptet den Wettkampf zu gewinnen.
b. ^* (Es ist bekannt, dass) der Sportler den Wettkampf zu gewinnen behauptet.
c. (Es ist bekannt, dass) der Sportler behauptet den Wettkampf zu gewinnen.
:::

All diatheses in this book are monoclausal (by definition). Besides trying to list all German diatheses, I will also catalogue all monoclausal alternations without any change in role-marking (i.e. without diathesis). Such alternations will be called ~~Epitheses~~. This book can thus also be read as a collection of all German monoclausal constructions, with or without role remapping. Somewhat unexpectedly, the number of alternations with role remapping (i.e. diathesis) is about twice as large as the number of monoclausal alternations without changes in role marking (i.e. epithesis).

When the above definition of monoclausality is strictly followed, then there turn out to be dozens of verbs that can be used as the finite 'auxiliary' in a coherent multi-verb clause. When used as finite auxiliaries, these verbs are grammaticalised, i.e. they shed much of their lexical meaning when used in a multi-verb construction. Such grammaticalised verbs are classified into different groups and referred to by many different names in the German grammatical literature, for examples *Hilfsverb*, *Kopulaverb*, *Modalverb*, *Modalitätsverb*, *Halbmodalverb* [@eisenberg2006a], *Nebenverb* [@engel1996: 406], *Funktionsverb* [Polenz 1963 cited in @kamber2008: 34], *Strukturverb* [@weber2005], or *Stützverb* [Seelbach 1991 cited in @kamber2008: 34]. I will not pursue the question here how to classify these verbs into different kinds. I will simply refer to the whole group of these auxiliary verbs as ~~light verbs~~.^[The same English term 'light verb' has recently also been used as a translation of the German term *Funktionsverb* [@fleischhauer2019; @fleischhauer2021; @fleischhauer2021a]. Actually, both that use and my use of the term 'light verb' are instances of a more general overarching concept. The *Funktionsverb* can be specified as a 'light verb with a nominal main predicate'. In contrast, in this book the term 'light verb' is used for a 'light verb with a verbal main predicate' (cf. [@sec:zuminfinitive-funktionsverb]).] All light verbs that will be discussed in this book are shown in alphabetical order in [@next].

::: ex

:::

### Grammaticalisation of lexical meaning {#sec:intro-lexical-meanings}

It is not always immediately clear whether a verb remains the same verb in a clause alternation. For example, the verb *trinken* means 'to drink' when used as a transitive verb [@next a]. In contrast, when used intransitively it contains a strong insinuation that the drinking includes too much alcohol, so it might better be translated as 'to be an alcoholic' [@next b]. In effect, the transitive and the intransitive use of *trinken* have a different meaning. However, in this case, the special intransitive meaning is probably best analysed as a conversational implicature because the suggestion of alcoholism can be suppressed given the right context [@next c].

::: ex
- Er trinkt einen Orangensaft.
- Er trinkt.
- Er trinkt hastig, weil er durstig ist.
:::

In general, when the same lexical verb is used in different alternating constructions, then there is (of course) a difference in meaning between the two occurrences. However, ideally this difference is completely induced by the alternation and not by the lexical verb itself. Yet, it is extremely common for the combination of a lexical verb with the surrounding construction to grammaticalise into a new meaning. For example, the verb *auftreten* means something like 'to act' as an intransitive [@next a], but 'to kick open' as a transitive [@next b]. Both meanings originate as metaphorical extensions from the meaning 'to step on something (by foot)'. 

::: ex
- Er ist in der Oper aufgetreten.
- Er hat die Tür aufgetreten.
:::

Likewise, historical processes can lead to current homophony of two different lexemes. For example, this appears to be the case with the verb *abhauen*, which has a transitive meaning 'to cut off' [@next a]. However, it has attained another usage during the course of the 20th century as an intransitive meaning 'to run away' [@next b], probably based on a southern German dialectal meaning of *hauen* 'to go, to walk'.^[Pfeiffer [-@pfeiffer1993], entry *hauen* at https://www.dwds.de/wb/etymwb/hauen, accessed 12 December 2018.]

::: ex
- Er hat den Ast abgehauen.
- Er ist abgehauen.
:::

In between those extremes (i.e. conversational implicature as with *trinken* and different lexicalisation as with *abhauen*) there are various intermediate stages of semantic separation. For example, the verb *hängen* 'to hang' can be used as a regular intransitive verb with a location [@next a]. However, the specific combination with the preposition *an* can also have a special meaning 'being emotionally attached to something' [@next b]. In this case it seems most appropriate to interpret the combination *hängen an* as a separate lexicalisation, although the path of the grammaticalisation to this new interpretation can still be intuitively grasped.

::: ex
- Er hängt an einem Seil.
- Er hängt an seinem Teddy.
:::

As with all grammaticalisation, it is often difficult to decide where to draw the line on the continuum between implicature (*trinken*), metaphorical extension (*auftreten*), contextual lexicalisation (*hängen an*) or completely different lexicalisation (*abhauen*). I tend to be rather lenient in allowing slightly different meanings still to be counted as diatheses of the 'same' verb. However, I will exclude clear examples of grammaticalised lexicalisation and treat those as separate verbs.

### Lexeme-specific lexical roles {#sec:intro-lexical-roles}

A crucial aspect of diathesis is that the lexical roles of a specific verb do not change, only the grammatical encoding of the roles is modified. For example, the verb *füllen* 'to fill' occurs in various monoclausal constructions [@next] but the roles of (i) 'filler', (ii) 'filled container' and (iii) 'filling substance' remain the same. The different grammatical forms that are used to express these roles are indexed with the corresponding subscripts in the examples below.

::: ex
a. [Der Koch]~i~ füllt [den Topf]~ii~ [mit dem Reis]~iii~.
b. [Der Koch]~i~ füllt [den Reis]~iii~ [in den Topf]~ii~.
c. [Der Reis]~iii~ füllt [dem Koch]~i~ [den Magen]~ii~.
d. [Der Koch]~i~ füllt sich [den Magen]~ii~.
d. [Der Blumentopf]~ii~ füllt sich [mit Wurzeln]~iii~.
:::

Already from this example it becomes clear that it is often really difficult, if not impossible, to attach a specific valency to a verb. Given that most (and possibly all) German verbs show some kind of diathesis, I reject the traditional notion of a fixed valency belonging to a specific verb (see [@sec:intro-valency] for a more extensive discussion). Alternatively, I propose that it is possibly to list all ~~lexeme-specific roles~~ (or equivalently ~~lexical roles~~) as a fixed characteristic of each lexical verb. The following three criteria will be used to determine the lexical roles of a verb.

First, each role that is case-marked in at least one clause alternant is a lexeme-specific role. In the example of *füllen* in [@last], each of the three roles is marked as nominative, accusative or dative in at least one of the alternants, so all three roles are lexeme-specific. Various exceptions and stipulations to this criterion are discussed in [@sec:case-delimiting-arguments].

Second, all obligatory prepositional phrases are lexeme-specific roles. Some verbs obligatorily require such a location, like *sich befinden* [@next], see [@sec:prepositions-obligatory-local]. More widespread are diatheses that introduce an obligatory location, like the caused-motion diathesis with *waschen* [@nnext], see [@sec:prepositions-partitive-free].

::: ex
a. Der Stuhl befindet sich im Wohnzimmer
b. ^* Der Stuhl befindet sich.
:::

::: ex
c. Ich wasche den Fleck aus meiner Hose.
d. ^* Ich wasche den Fleck.
:::

Third, there is a large class of lexeme-specific prepositional phrases that I will call ~~governed prepositions~~, like with *arbeiten an* 'to work on' [@next a]. These prepositional phrases are not obligatorily present [@next b]. However, the intuition behind governed prepositions is that these prepositions are lexically determined by the verb and often strongly grammaticalised both semantically and structurally. For example, the preposition *an* with the verb *arbeiten* 'to work' [@next a] is semantically strongly bleached with none of its local meaning remaining. Syntactically, the prepositional phrase in *arbeiten an* can be paraphrased with a complement clause of the form *daran, dass* [@next c]. The possibility of such a syntactic paraphrase will be used as the main characteristic to identify governed prepositions. Various exceptions and stipulations to this criterion are discussed in [@sec:prepositions-delimiting-governed-prepositional-phrases]. 

::: ex
a. Ich arbeite an meinem Buch.
b. Ich arbeite hart.
c. Ich arbeite daran, dass das Buch bald fertig wird.
:::

Under this approach, there are a few lexical roles that appear to be very widespread, up to the point of seemingly being universally applicable to all verbs. If that would be the case, then it would defeat the idea of lexeme-specific roles. However, on closer inspection it appears that there are no roles that apply to all verbs. The closest contender is, arguably, the role of causer, which can be introduced to almost any German verb by using the *lassen+In­fi­ni­tiv* diathesis [@next], see [@sec:infinitive-lassen-causative]. However, there is a small group of verbs that do not allow for this diathesis, like *gefallen* 'to like' [@nnext]. This shows that even virtually universal roles are still lexically determined in German.

::: ex
a. Der Student arbeitet an einer Aufgabe.
b. Der Professor lässt den Studenten an einer Aufgabe arbeiten.
:::

::: ex
a. Dein Haarschnitt gefällt mir.
b. ^* Er lässt mir seinen Haarschnitt gefallen.
:::

Such lexeme-specific roles are called 'verb-specific semantic roles' in Van Valin [-@van-valin2004] and 'microroles' in Hartmann et al. [-@hartmann2014]. The obvious next step (as discussed in both these papers) is to group such microroles into clusters of semantic/thematic meso­roles, i.e. widespread roles like agent, patient, experiencer, etc. Such semantic roles are used constantly in contemporary linguistics, but they are surprisingly ill-defined. For example, given a random German verb like *füllen* as exemplified at the start of this section, it is not clear at all what should be its semantic roles, and what criteria should be used to determine them. Hartmann et al. [-@hartmann2014] and Cysouw [-@cysouw2014a] use cross-linguistic data to approach this problem. However, such an approach does not allow for language-specific definitions, which is the problem here.

As a solution, I propose to use the applicability of a diathesis as a criterion for the language-specific determination of semantic mesoroles. For example, a 'German patient' might be defined as the group of those lexical roles that are changed from accusative to nominative in the *werden+Partizip* passive diathesis. Note that this definition is not supposed to satisfy all intuitions that surround the notion 'patient' in linguistics. Quite to the contrary, the proposal is to ~~define~~ a semantic role like 'patient' on the basis of applicable diatheses and adapt any intuitions to that definition (or, if that feels too radical, simply use a different name for the newly defined semantic role, like *Leidtragende*). Even more general, a semantic role could also be defined by the cross section of multiple diatheses. The determination of suitable (combinations of) diatheses to define semantic roles for German will not be pursued here, but left for a follow-up investigation.

### Domain of application and verb classes {#sec:intro-domain-of-application}

A widespread assumption in linguistic analysis is that most alternations (including diatheses) have a sensible domain of application. This is the idea that there is some rationale, often a kind of semantic characterisation, explaining which roots allow for a specific kind of linguistic marking (e.g. only transitive verbs allow for a *werden* passive).^[For example, compare the infamous sentence on the first page of Levin [-@levin1993: 1 ] "the behavior of a verb, particularly with respect to the expression and interpretation of its arguments, is to a large extent determined by its meaning." In contrast to that claim, Levin in practice uses form to establish classes of verbs, not meaning. That practical approach is also taken here.] Although I also believe that many alternations, including diatheses, mostly behave sensibly, I would advise not to expect too much (semantic) regularity to be hidden in grammatical structure. Many grammatical regularities have unexpected exceptions, be it because of haphazard diachronic change or through creative analogical extension. Even stronger, some grammatical marking appears to be almost completely without (semantic) rationale, like the assignment of plural allomorphy in German. If that can happen in morphology, it can also happen in syntax.

As a practical approach to determine the domain of application (say, which verbs allow for the *werden+Partizip* passive) I propose to always first enumerate as much examples as possible. In other words, first empirically establish a verb class of those verbs that happen to be possible with an alternation. In this book, I will not be satisfied with four or five cases that suggest a neat semantic characterisation for a specific diathesis. In contrast, I will list as many as possible further examples, idiosyncratic as they may be. Only after such a formal listing of the domain of application (which ideally needs much more corpus research than I have been able to perform here) is it possible to investigate the presence of any (semantic) rationale. In many cases there might be a (partial) rationale for the attested group of verbs, but it is just as likely (and just as interesting) to have to conclude that there apparently is none.

Taking this principle one step further, I propose to ~~define~~ the domain of application by the concrete listing of all examples. Any (semantic) characterisation is then always a post-hoc generalisation, not a definition. This radically lexicalist interpretation is the approach that I will follow in this book. For each diathesis I will list as many as possible example verbs that take part in the diatheses (for some I will reverse the approach and list verbs that are not possible). These lexical lists (i.e. the empirical verb classes) are the definition of the domain of application. For some diatheses I will speculate about semantic generalisations, but I consider these generalisations always to be secondary to the concrete listing of examples. My semantic generalisations are thus never a causal explanation.

This principle of definition by listing even holds for questions of productivity. For example, when somebody would propose a nonce-verb like *flurchten* to be a new verb for the German language in an experimental setting, then its meaning is partially defined by stipulating what kind of diatheses it can take part in. For example, the following constructions might, or might not, be chosen in examples that contextualise the new verb. The choices made will strongly influence the interpretation of the new verb.

::: ex
a. Ich flurchte den Gärtner.
b. Ich flurchte auf den Gärtner.
c. Ich flurchte mich vor den Gärtner.
d. Der Gärtner flurchtet.
e. Der Gärtner flurchtet sich.
:::

### Functional analysis {#sec:intro-functional-analysis}

Intimately connected to the domain of application (i.e. which verbs allow for which diathesis) is the question as to the meaning/function of a specific diathesis. In essence, this question asks for a description of the difference in meaning between the two alternants of a diathesis. For example, what is the difference between the transitive *schließen* [@next a] and the corresponding reflexive anticausative *sich schließen* [@next b], cf. [@sec:reflexive-anticausative]. Although the answer might seem obvious for some diatheses, it turns out to be extremely difficult to give a concise description of such differences for most diatheses, and I will regularly refrain from trying to provide such a descriptions. Each diathesis is actually its own research project, preferably investigated using predictive corpus analysis [cf. the large literature on the English dative alternation, or for German @devaere2018]. 

::: ex
a. Ich schließe die Tür.
b. Die Tür schließt sich. 
:::

There are two empirical pieces of information that are crucial for such a functional analysis of a diathesis. The first key datapoint is the actual lists of verbs that allow for a specific diathesis (i.e. the verb class as defined by a diathesis, see the previous [@sec:intro-domain-of-application]). The second important consideration is any restriction on the kind of nominals that can be used to fill the roles of a diathesis (i.e. nominal classes as defined by a diathesis). Both these classes can be established empirically by collecting and analysing a corpus of examples of a specific diathesis.

The problem of a functional description for a diathesis becomes even larger with the realisation that there are many dozens of diatheses, often highly similar to each other. For example, it is really difficult [cf. @schafer2007; @kurogo2016] to characterise the difference between the reflexive anticausative, like with *schließen* above in [@last], and the unmarked anticausative, like with *kochen* in [@next], see [@sec:case-haben-anticausative].

The problem of providing a concise functional description for a grammatical construction is not restricted to diatheses. Clause alternations that do not have any role-remapping are also in need of a functional description (see Chapter [-@sec:epithesis] for a survey). An example is the phenomenon of 'free' reflexives, illustrated with *ansehen* in  [@next], see [@sec:reflexive-free-dative-sich-accusative]. Although there is no role-remapping in this alternation (and thus no diathesis), it turns out to be really difficult to describe the difference between [@next a] without reflexive and [@next b] with reflexive. All clause alternations, with or without role-remapping, are in need of a functional analysis, and most such analyses will need substantial further research.

## Method

Methodologically, I regard the approach in this book as an attempt to unify grammatical research with lexicographic research, two aspects of linguistics that are often considered to be separate inquiries. In contrast to such a separation, I would like to propose a view of linguistics that might be called ~~grammar of the lexicon~~ [cf. @levin1993: 2--4, but one might just as well include all of construction grammar here]. In this approach, each grammatical phenomenon should always be linked to individual occurrences, either types (lexicon) or tokens (corpus). It is my experience from compiling the current compendium of diatheses that identifying and characterising a specific grammatical structure is really just 'step one' of grammatical research. Only by trying to find more examples, with different lexemes and in different contexts, it becomes clear how prominent and varying a grammatical structure really is.

As as rule-of-thumb, I propose the ~~10-in-10-rule~~ as 'step two' of grammatical research. If you think that a particular construction is widespread, or maybe typical for a specific class of words (e.g. typical for 'intransitives'), then take 10 minutes to search for examples, either in your own intuitions or in one of the many online databases or corpora. Resources like the *Digitales Wörterbuch der deutschen Sprache* ([DWDS](https://www.dwds.de)), the various online offerings of the *Institut für Deutsche Sprache* ([IDS](https://www1.ids-mannheim.de/onlineangebote)), or just a Google 'exact search' are literally just a click away and completely rejuvenate linguistic research. If you are not able to list 10 examples in 10 minutes, then go back to the drawing board and reconsider your intuitions.

Such quick-and-dirty 10-minute surveys of course still only represent a preliminary step of grammatical analysis. It is this level of detail that I have aimed for in this book (although I have often spend way more than 10 minutes searching for examples of a specific diathesis). Each sub-subsection about an individual diathesis lists lexemes that can be used with this diathesis. It includes examples of the diathesis, either from my own intuitions or from any of the above mentioned databases. I plan to expand and fine-tune these lists in future revisions of this book.

However, the real research is only yet to come. 'Step three' would be the in-depth investigation of individual diatheses by sampling examples from corpora and formulating predictive parameters to explain their usage. For example, De Vaere *et al.* [-@devaere2018] investigate the dative antipassive (see [@sec:prepositions-dative-antipassive-accusative]) for just the single verb *geben*. Now, there are hundreds of diatheses and hundreds of verbs listed in this book, so there are tens of thousands of similar research projects just waiting to be tackled.

## Previous research

The current attempt to present an all-encompassing survey of German diatheses builds on a rich scholarly tradition (with many scholarly precursors to be cited in appropriate places throughout this book). A comparable and highly influential survey of diathesis for English is Levin [-@levin1993], followed by a similar attempt for German by Sauerland [-@sauerland1994]. A recent cross-linguistic survey of valency and diathesis in this tradition is edited by Malchukov & Comrie [-@malchukov2015a], which also includes data on German [@haspelmath2013a].

Independently, there is a long tradition in the German grammatical literature to investigate diathesis, e.g. as '*Konversenverhältnis der Aktanten*' [@eroms1980: 24; cf. @heringer1968]. An early attempt at a survey of various diatheses is presented by Höhle [-@hohle1978]. Basic summaries of German diathesis in the context of valency can be found in Eroms [-@eroms2000: Ch. 10] or Ágel [-@agel2000: Ch. 6]. There also are a few monographs about specific German diatheses [e.g. @leirbukt1997; @holl2010; @jager2013] and recently some corpus studies into the effect of specific diatheses on individual verbs have appeared [@devaere2018; @imo2018; @dux2020: Ch. 6].

Diathesis is of course closely linked to the concept of valency, so the groundbreaking valency dictionary for German by Helbig and Schenkel [-@helbig1991, originally from 1969] deserves mentioning. They identify the problem that certain verbs can be used in different constructions, but diatheses are not investigated consistently in their dictionary. Another highly influential valency dictionary for German, edited by Schumacher [-@schumacher1986; also the precursor @engel1978], discusses passive diatheses for all verbs that are included. I regard the current survey of German diatheses as a next step to extend such valency dictionaries into even more all-encompassing dictionaries that discuss all possible clause constructions for each verb.

## Structure of this book

The structure of this book is somewhat unusual for a scholarly monograph. It is not a narrative with a painless beginning, a sturdy middle and a satisfying conclusion. Rather, this book is open ended, and it does not have a gratifying closure at the end. That is by design. It is an encyclopaedia after all.

The book consists of three different parts. First, Chapter 1 and 2 discuss the major theoretical considerations that guide the collection and organisation of the data. This is the part to read for insights into the nature of diathesis and sundry topics. Second, Chapter 3 and 4 are the closest to what this book has to offer in the way of a conclusion. Each of these chapters presents an astonishingly long list of grammatical constructions, summarising a selection of the major linguistic structures as identified in the remainder of this book. These summaries are intended to be a quick entry into the actual German language data, with ample cross-references to the following encyclopaedia. Finally, Chapter 5 to 13 make up the actual encyclopaedia, with separate sub-subsections about individual phenomena. Each of these sub-subsections is a fragment of a research project, sometimes mundane, but often full of surprising avenues for future research. 

Going through the chapters in more detail, this first chapter summarised the basic definitional properties of clauses and clause alternations. The next Chapter [-@sec:structure] describes in detail how diatheses are analysed and classified. Chapter [-@sec:summary] presents a summary of the about 80 major German diatheses and proposes German names for those structures. As a small extra, Chapter [-@sec:epithesis] summarises the about 40 major epithetical structures and provides an unconventional approach to the analysis of verbal categories of German.

Chapters [-@sec:case] to [-@sec:zuminfinitive] are the core part of this book. These chapter are database-like texts, discussing each clause structure separately. All of these chapters have exactly the same internal structure. Sometimes certain sections are empty, because there is no grammatical structure in that category. However, the headers of those empty sections have been preserved for the sake of parallel numbering across chapters. The following structure is used in all data chapters:

- Section X.1 is a concise introduction into the kind of diatheses discussed.
- Section X.2 is a detailed discussion of the relevant grammatical definitions.
- Section X.3 lists deponent structures \
  (i.e structures that look like diathesis, but there is no alternation).
- Section X.4 lists epitheses \
  (i.e. alternations with the relevant structure, but there is no diathesis).
- Section X.5 lists diatheses with subject demotion.
- Section X.6 lists diatheses with promotion to subject.
- Section X.7 lists diatheses with object demotion.
- Section X.8 lists diatheses with promotion to object.
- Section X.9 lists symmetrical diatheses.

In these data chapters, each diathesis has its own sub-subsection with a unique section header that can be used as a name to refer to the diathesis (e.g. [@sec:participles-werden-passive] on the '*werden+Partizip* Passive'). Many of these unique names are quite boring, but hopefully descriptively useful for future reference. More imaginative German names are only added for the major diatheses. Individual verbs are listed with each diathesis to show the extend of its applicability. Often a section with further examples is added to illustrate the diathesis. Neither these lists of verbs nor the examples are intended to be exhaustive in any way. Sometimes an additional section with notes is provided to discuss idiosyncrasies of individual verbs. All this information should be read as a first step towards a more in-depth research into individual diatheses and into the constructional possibilities that are available to individual verbs.
