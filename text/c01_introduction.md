# Setting the scene {#sec:intro}

## The daunting diversity of diathesis

The quintessential example of German diathesis, found in virtually every grammatical descriptions of German, is the *werden+Partizip* passive construction [@next a]. A central characteristic of this construction is that the state-of-affairs as described by this passive is fundamentally the same as in the corresponding active [@next b], though the sentence structure of course differs between the two expressions.

::: ex
a. Das Gemälde wird (von einem Künstler) gemalt.
b. Der Künstler malt ein Gemälde.
:::

This approach to diathesis, viz. different grammatical sentence structures that express approximately the same state-of-affairs, is applicable to a large number of grammatical phenomena in German. For example, some verbs allow for passive-like constructions without any *werden* auxiliary, often called 'anticausative' [@next a]. Other verbs allow for an alternation between a case-marked accusative and a prepositional phrase, often called 'antipassive' [@next b]. Further, there exist many different kinds of diathesis marked by a reflexive pronoun *sich* [@next c] or marked by preverbs like *ent-* [@next d]. Many auxiliary-like construction beyond the *werden+Infinitiv* passive also show diathesis, e.g. *sein+zu‑Infinitiv* [@next e].^[Many examples in this book contain masculine nouns, not because of laziness on my behalf, but because their definite articles overtly show the different German cases (*der, des, dem, den*). Notwithstanding this grammatical preference, I will try to use examples with as much diversity as possible throughout this book.]

::: ex
a. Der Doktor heilt den Schmerz. \
   Der Schmerz heilt (durch den Doktor).
b. Der Jäger schießt den Bären. \
   Der Jäger schießt auf den Bären.
c. Der Lehrer beklagt den Lärm. \
   Der Lehrer beklagt sich über den Lärm.
d. Der Kandidat stammt aus einem Adelsgeschlecht. \
   Der Kandidat entstammt einem Adelsgeschlecht
e. Der Ermittler löst den Fall. \
   Der Fall ist (für den Ermittler) leicht zu lösen.
:::

All in all, there are about 250 different German diatheses described in this book, some highly productive, some only attested for a handful of verbs. The main goal of this book is to present this wealth of grammatical possibility in a unified manner, while at the same time attempting to classify and organise this diversity. I will make no attempt to fit all these constructional possibilities of the German language into any specific grammatical framework, although the collection of diatheses presented here might be taken as a modelling-challenge for your favourite grammatical theory.

It might come as a surprise that there are so many different diatheses in German, but my impression is that German is no exception among the world's languages in this respect. I expect that all languages have a wealth of different ways in which to construe a sentence around a lexical predicate. In a sense, diatheses allow for the expression of different perspectives on the event described, something that is arguably a common desire of any language user.

## Defining diathesis {#sec:intro-basic-definition}

A diathesis is defined here as special kind of alternation between two different clause constructions. To properly define the notion 'diathesis', I will first define 'alternation' in general. Next, the definition of 'clause alternation' will be built on that basis. Finally, a diathesis will then be defined as special kind of clause alternation. A few crucial concepts that are used in the following definitions will be discussed in more detail in subsequent sections.

#### Alternation {.unnumbered}

An ~~alternation~~ (or simply 'grammatical marking') is defined as follows:

- An alternation consist of two different linguistic constructions, i.e. there are two alternants.
- The lexical root (or possibly larger linguistic entity) does not change in the alternation, i.e. there is some fundamental linguistic material in both alternants that remains the same.
- Typically, the difference between these alternants is overtly indicated by the presence of some grammatical linguistic elements.
- Typically, the overt marking introduces a direction into the alternation, i.e. one alternant consists of less/shorter/zero linguistic elements ('less marked') and one consists of more/longer/overt linguistic material ('more marked'). In some cases, the direction of the alternation remains undecidable, i.e. the alternation is equipollent.
- The set of roots (or possibly larger linguistic entities) to which the alternation applies form an empirical linguistic class. Such an empirical class often has a semantic/functional interpretation, but not necessarily so.

Alternations are the basis of all grammatical analysis.^[There is an interesting, almost philosophical, issue here that I will not delve into, namely whether the basis of grammatical analysis are the constructions themselves (cf. construction grammar) or the alternations between constructions. The statement in the main text should indeed be taken as a proposal that alternations are the more crucial entities. An alternation is the equivalent in morphosyntax of a phonological minimal pair. Alternation are also useful in the practice of grammatical description. For example, the meaning/function of a construction is often hard to describe in full, while the meaning/function of an alternation can simply be described by the difference in meaning between the alternants. Only the crucial aspect that is added by an alternation needs to be captured – a task which is already difficult enough though. Similar intuitions about the importance of alternations have lead to the development of transformations [@harris1957].] They include for example:

i. morphological oppositions, like singular *Haus* 'house' vs. plural *Häuser* 'houses'.
ii. oppositions of grammatical forms, like synthetic present *er schläft* 'he sleeps' vs. analytic perfect *er hat geschlafen* 'he has slept' 
iii. different sentence constructions attested with specific verbs, like transitive *Ich verkaufe das Buch* 'I sell the book' vs. reflexive anticausative with obligatory adverbial *Das Buch verkauft sich gut* 'the book is selling well' (see [@sec:adverbial-reflexive-transitive-anticausative]).

#### Clause alternation {.unnumbered}

Based on the definition of an alternation, a ~~clause alternation~~ is defined as follows:

- In a clause alternation both alternants are monoclausal, i.e. both alternants contain a single main predicate. For German, the definitional property of monoclausality will be a phenomenon called 'coherence' (see [@sec:intro-coherence]).
- In both alternants, the main predicate consists of the same lexeme, i.e both contain the same verb and the meaning of the lexical verb does not (substantially) change between the alternants (see [@sec:intro-lexical-meanings]).
- The lexical roles of the verb do not change between the alternants. Lexical roles are an inherent part of the meaning of a verb and alternations do not change them. Note, however, that there might be new roles introduced or some roles might be left unexpressed (see [@sec:intro-lexical-roles]).
- The meaning/function of the whole clause changes between the alternants. This functional difference is the whole point of having a clause alternation in the first place (see [@sec:intro-functional-analysis]).
- A specific clause alternation is only applicable to a restricted set of verbs. The list of applicable verbs constitutes the domain of application of the alternation. Any semantic/syntactic characterisation of these applicable verbs should be seen as a summary of the domain of application, not its definition (see [@sec:intro-domain-of-application]).

Clause alternations are widespread when auxiliaries are introduced, like modal *müssen* 'have to' [@next a], see [@sec:infinitive-modals]. However, clause alternations are attested with many more different kinds of marking, like the verb particle *auf* marking completeness of the action [@next b], see [@sec:prepositions-accusative-antipassive], or the somewhat mysterious 'free' reflexive *sich* with verbs like *ansehen* 'look at' [@next c], see [@sec:reflexive-free-dative-sich-accusative]. Arguably, the special word order in German subordinate clauses (viz. the finite verb occurs clause-final) can also be considered to be a clause alternation [@next d].

::: ex
a. Er erledigt seine Hausaufgaben. \
   Er muss seine Hausaufgaben erledigen.
b. Ich esse den Apfel. \
   Ich esse den Apfel auf.
c. Er hat das Haus angesehen. \
   Er hat sich das Haus angesehen.
d. Er erledigt seine Hausaufgaben. \
   Ich hoffe, dass er seine Hausaufgaben erledigt.
:::

#### Diathesis {.unnumbered}

Based on the notion of a clause alternation, a ~~diathesis~~ (sometimes also known as 'valency alternation') is defined as follows:

- A diathesis is a clause alternation in which at least one of the lexical roles is overtly marked differently between the clausal alternants, i.e. at least one of the roles is remapped to a different grammatical expression. In other words, a diathesis is a clause alternation with a co-occurring role-marking alternation (see [@sec:intro-diathetical-operations]).
- Remapped roles do not substantially change their meaning, i.e. 'who does what to whom' does not change. However, the details of the relation between the main predicate and the remapped roles can (and normally will) change. There will be slight changes in meaning, e.g. aspects like the role's influence on the action, or its affectedness by the predicate, might change. As an extreme case, the remapping of a role can consist in the addition of a completely new role or in the complete removal of an existing role (see [@sec:intro-valency]).
- As is true for all alternations, a diathesis has a direction from a formally 'less marked' to a 'more marked' alternant. However, in some special instances a diathesis can show no other overt marking than the change in marking of the reframed roles itself. This will be called a covert (or equipollent, or bare) diathesis. The different forms of marking of diatheses are the basic organisational structure of this book (see [@sec:intro-voice]).
- As a practical restriction, I will only consider diatheses in which one alternant is a basic clause with a single finite verb. In principle, when there is a diathesis between a basic clause and structure A, and another diathesis between a basic clause and Structure B, then there is also a diathesis between structures A and B. However, such diatheses are not included here. It is a major goal of this book to present a precise description of the mappings between basic clauses and all attested diatheses (see [@sec:intro-naming]).

The prototypical example of a diathesis is the *werden+Partizip* passive [@next a], see [@sec:participles-werden-passive]. In both clause alternants the same state of affairs is described, but the marking of the participants is different. However, the diversity of diatheses in German is enormous as this book attempts to show. There are, for example, covert diatheses (i.e. diatheses without any marking on the verb) like the infamous anticausative in [@next b], see [@sec:case-haben-anticausative], or antipassives marked with a reflexive pronoun as shown in [@next c], see [@sec:reflexive-accusative-antipassive].

b. Ich koche den Kaffee. \
   Der Kaffee kocht.
c. Der Fahrradfahrer fürchtet den Anstieg. \
   Der Fahrradfahrer fürchtet sich vor dem Anstieg.
:::

Hidden in these succinct definitions there are various intricate grammatical concepts that need some more discussion in subsequent sections. The most general notions are discussed directly below, while the specific discussion of the analysis and classification of different kinds of diathesis is postponed for the next chapter.

## Definitional details

### Monoclausality and coherence {#sec:intro-coherence}

Diatheses are defined here as alternations between single clauses with the same main verb. However, a single clause in German can sometimes consist of multiple verb forms. It is crucial to strictly distinguish between situations in which a multi-verb construction is monoclausal and when it is not. The basis of the definition of monoclausality in German is a concept called ~~coherence~~.

All diatheses listed in this book are monoclausal. Besides trying to list all German diatheses, I will also list all non-diathetical clause alternation, i.e monoclausal alternations without any change in role-marking (these are always listed in the .4 section of each data chapter). This book can thus also be read as a listing of all German monoclausal constructions, with or without role remapping. Somewhat unexpectedly, the number of alternations without any role remapping (i.e. the alternations without diathesis) is much smaller than the number of monoclausal alternations with changes in role marking (i.e. the diatheses).

To define monoclausality, the crucial characteristic of German syntax is that the finite verb is moved to the end of the sentence in a subordinate clauses. I will use the dummy main sentence *Es ist bekannt, dass…* 'it is known that' to force a subordinate construction. The position of the finite verb in the subordinate clause can be used the identify the boundary of the clause: everything that can occur before the finite verb belongs within the clause; everything that has to come after the finite verb belongs to a different clause. For example, the simple sentence [@next a] will turn into [@next b] as a subordinate clause, with the finite verb at the end; [@next c] with constituents after the finite verb is not possible. So the whole sentence in [@next a] is a single clause. Constructions with such a pattern will be called ~~coherent~~, following Bech [-@bech1955]; see also Kiss [-@kiss1995] for a more in-depth and more extensive discussion of the concept 'coherence'. Coherent constructions are considered to be ~~monoclausal~~.

::: ex
a. Ich gehe morgen nach Hause.
b. Es ist bekannt, dass ich morgen nach Hause gehe.
c. ^* Es ist bekannt, dass ich gehe morgen nach Hause.
:::

Exactly the same coherence is attested in auxiliary constructions with participles [@next] and infinitives [@nnext]. Such constructions are also monoclausal.

::: ex
a. Ich habe gestern ein Haus gekauft.
b. Es ist bekannt, dass ich gestern ein Haus gekauft habe.
c. ^* Es ist bekannt, dass ich gestern gekauft habe ein Haus.
:::

::: ex
a. Ich will morgen ein Haus kaufen.
b. Es ist bekannt, dass ich morgen ein Haus kaufen will.
c. ^* Es ist bekannt, dass ich morgen kaufen will ein Haus.
:::

Constructions with *zu* and infinitive are sometimes coherent, e.g. [@next] with the finite verb *geben* 'to give', and sometimes non-coherent, e.g. [@nnext] with the finite verb *behaupten* 'to claim'. The coherent construction in [@next a] is thus monoclausal, while the non-coherent construction in [@nnext a] consists of two clauses.

::: ex
a. Der Protest gibt ihr zu denken.
b. Es ist bekannt, dass der Protest ihr zu denken gibt.
c. ^* Es ist bekannt, dass der Protest gibt ihr zu denken.
:::

::: ex
a. Der Sportler behauptet den Wettkampf zu gewinnen.
b. ^* Es ist bekannt, dass der Sportler den Wettkampf zu gewinnen behauptet.
c. Es ist bekannt, dass der Sportler behauptet den Wettkampf zu gewinnen.
:::

In some intermediate cases both orders are possible, as shown with the finite verb *helfen* 'to help' in [@next].

::: ex
a. Ich helfe dir den Koffer zu tragen.
b. Es ist bekannt, dass ich dir helfe den Koffer zu tragen.
c. Es ist bekannt, dass ich dir den Koffer zu tragen helfe.
:::

Maybe surprisingly, when the above definition of monoclausality is strictly followed, then there appear to be dozens of verbs that can be used as the finite 'auxiliary' in a coherent multi-verb construction. When used as finite auxiliaries, these verbs are more or less strongly grammaticalised, i.e. they shed much of their lexical meaning when used in multi-verb constructions. Such grammaticalised verbs are classified into different groups and referred to by many different names in the German grammatical literature, e.g. *Hilfsverb*, *Kopulaverb*, *Modalverb*, *Modalitätsverb*, *Halbmodalverb* [@eisenberg2006a], *Funktionsverb* [Polenz 1963 cited in @kamber2008: 34], *Strukturverb* [@weber2005], or *Stützverb* [Seelbach 1991 cited in @kamber2008: 34]. I will not pursue the question here how to classify these verbs into different kinds. I will simply refer to the whole group of these 'auxiliary' verbs as ~~light verbs~~. All light verbs that will be discussed in later chapters are shown here in alphabetical order in [@next], though note that not all of them are involved in diathesis. A few of the verbs listed below are only attested in monoclausal alternation without diathesis.

::: ex

:::

### Grammaticalisation of lexical meaning {#sec:intro-lexical-meanings}

A difficult problem is the question whether it is really the same verb that is used in two alternating constructions of a diathesis. For example, the verb *trinken* 'to drink' is a regular transitive verb, but when used intransitively, *er trinkt* 'he drinks', it has a clear implication that his drinking includes too much alcohol, so it might be better translated as 'he is an alcoholic'. In this case, this intransitive interpretation is probably best analysed as a conventional implicature, because the alcoholism aspect of the meaning can be suppressed given the right context.

In general, when the same lexical verb is used in different alternating constructions, then there is (of course) a difference in meaning between the two occurrences. However, ideally this difference is completely induced by the respective constructions and not by the lexical verb itself. Yet, it is extremely common for the combination of a lexical verb with the surrounding construction to grammaticalise into a new meaning. For example, the verb *auftreten* means something like 'to act' as an intransitive, but *to kick open* as a transitive. Both meanings originate from the meaning 'to step on something (by foot)'. Likewise, historical processes can lead to current homophony of two different lexemes. This appears to be the case for example with the verb *abhauen*, which is a transitive verb meaning 'cut of' (e.g. *Er hat den Ast abgehauen*). However, it has attained another usage during the course of the 20th century as an intransitive verb meaning 'run away' (e.g. *Er ist abgehauen*), probably based on a southern German dialectal meaning of *hauen* 'to go, to walk' [@pfeiffer1993: "hauen", accessed 12.12.2018].

In between those extremes (i.e. conventional implicature and different lexicalisation) there exist various intermediate phenomena. For example, the verb *hängen* 'to hang' can be used as a regular intransitive verb with a location, like *Er hängt an einem Seil* 'He dangles to a rope', but the specific combination with the preposition *an* can also have a special reading of 'being emotionally attached to something', like in *Er hängt an seinem Teddy* 'He is (emotionally) attached to his Teddy'. In this case it seems most appropriate to interpret the combination *hängen an* as a separate lexicalisation, though the path of the conventional implicature can still be intuitively grasped.

As with all grammaticalisation processes, it is often difficult to decide where to draw the line on the continuum between conventional implicature, metaphorical extension (*trinken*) and contextual lexicalisation (*hängen an*) or completely different lexicalisation (*auftreten*, *abhauen*). I tend to be rather lenient in allowing slightly different meanings to be included as the 'same' verb, but will exclude clear examples of the latter two types on the continuum as separate lexicalisations of homophonous elements.

### Lexeme-specific lexical roles {#sec:intro-lexical-roles}

A crucial aspect of diathesis is that the lexical roles of a specific verb do not change, only the grammatical encoding of the roles changes. For example, the verb *füllen* 'to fill' occurs in various monoclausal constructions [@next], but the roles of (i) 'filler', (ii) 'filled container' and (iii) 'filling substance' are always the same. The different grammatical forms that are used to express these roles are added as subscripts to each sentence in the examples below.

::: ex
a. Ich~i:\ NOM~ fülle den Topf~ii:\ ACC~ (mit Reis~iii:\ PREP~).
b. Ich~i:\ NOM~ fülle den Reis~iii:\ ACC~ in den Topf~ii:\ PREP~.
c. Der Reis~iii:\ NOM~ füllt (mir~i:\ DAT~) den Magen~ii:\ ACC~.
d. Der Blumentopf~ii:\ NOM~ füllt sich (mit Wurzeln~iii:\ PREP~).
:::

Already from this example it becomes clear that it is often really difficult, if not impossible, to attach a specific valency to a verb. Given that most (and possibly all) German lexemes show some kind of diathesis, I reject the traditional notion of a fixed valency belonging to a specific verb (see [@sec:intro-valency] for a more extensive discussion). Alternatively, I propose that it is possibly to list all ~~lexeme-specific roles~~ (or equivalently ~~lexical roles~~) as a fixed characteristic of each lexical verb. The following criteria will be used to determine the lexical roles of a verb:

First, each role that is case-marked in at least one clause-alternant is a lexeme-specific role. In the example of *füllen* in [@last], each of the three roles is marked as nominative, accusative or dative in at least one of the alternants, so all three roles are lexeme-specific. Various exceptions and stipulations to this criterion are discussed in [@sec:case-delimiting-arguments].

Second, all obligatory prepositional phrases are lexeme-specific roles. Such prepositional phrases, that cannot be left out, are not very widespread in German and mostly designate a location. Some verbs always expect such a location-role [@next a,b], see e.g. [@sec:prepositions-obligatory-local, @sec:reflexive-obligatory-local], but more widespread are resultative diatheses that introduce an obligatory local role [@next c,d], see e.g. [@sec:prepositions-action-result].

::: ex
a. Der Stuhl befindet sich im Wohnzimmer
b. ^* Der Stuhl befindet sich.
c. Ich breche ein Loch in den Felsen.
d. ^* Ich breche ein Loch.
:::

Third, there is a large class of lexeme-specific prepositional phrases that I will call ~~governed prepositions~~, like *arbeiten an* 'to work on' [@next a]. These prepositional phrases are not obligatorily present [@next b]. The intuition behind governed prepositions is that these prepositions are lexically determined by the verb and often strongly grammaticalised both semantically and structurally. Semantically, the preposition *an* with the verb *arbeiten* 'to work' [@next a] is strongly bleached with none of its local 'touching' meaning remaining. Syntactically, the prepositional phrase in *arbeiten an* can be filled with a complement clause of the form *daran, dass…* [@next c]. This syntactic criterion will be used as the main characteristic to identify governed prepositions. Various exceptions and stipulations to this criterion are discussed in [@sec:prepositions-delimiting-governed-prepositional-phrases]. 

::: ex
a. Ich arbeite an meinem Buch.
b. Ich arbeite hart.
c. Ich arbeite daran, dass das Buch fertig wird.
:::

Under this approach, there are a few lexical roles that appear to be very widespread, up to the point of seemingly being universally applicable to all verbs. If that would be the case, then it would defeat the idea of lexeme-specific roles. However, on closer inspection my impression is that there are no roles that apply to all verbs. The closest contender is, arguably, the role of causer, which can be introduced to almost any German verb by using the *lassen+Infinitiv* diathesis [@next], see [@sec:infinitive-lassen-causative]. However, there is a small group of verbs that do not allow for this diathesis, like *gefallen* 'to like' [@nnext]. This shows that even virtually universal roles are still lexically determined.

::: ex
a. Der Student arbeitet an einer Aufgabe.
b. Der Professor lässt den Student an einer Aufgabe arbeiten.
:::

::: ex
a. Dein Haarschnitt gefällt mir.
b. ^* Er lässt mir seinen Haarschnitt gefallen.
:::

Such lexeme-specific roles are called 'verb-specific semantic roles' in Van Valin [-@van-valin2004] and 'microroles' in Hartmann et al. [-@hartmann2014]. The obvious next step (as discussed in both these papers) is to cluster such microroles into clusters of semantic/thematic mesoroles, i.e. widespread roles like 'agent', 'patiens', 'experiencer' etc. Such semantic roles are used constantly in contemporary linguistics, but they are surprisingly ill-defined. For example, given a random German verb like *füllen* as exemplified at the start of this section: what should be its semantic roles, and what criteria should be used to determine this? Hartmann et al. [-@hartmann2014] and Cysouw [-@cysouw2014a] use cross-linguistic data to approach this question. However, such an approach does not allow for language-specific definitions, which is the problem in the current example of German.

My proposal for a language-specific determination of semantic mesoroles is to use the applicability of diatheses as a criterion. For example, a 'German Patiens' might be defined as those lexical roles that are changed from accusative to nominative in the *werden* passive diathesis. Or more general: a semantic role can be defined by a combination of applicable diatheses. The research project to determine suitable combinations of diatheses will not be pursued here, but left for a follow-up investigation.

### Domain of application and verb classes {#sec:intro-domain-of-application}

A widespread assumption in linguistic analysis is that most alternations (including diatheses) have a sensible domain of application. This is the idea that there is some rationale, often a kind of semantic characterisation, explaining which roots allow for a specific kind of linguistic marking (e.g. only transitive verbs allow for a *werden* passive).^[For example, compare the infamous sentence on the first page of Levin [-@levin1993: 1] "the behavior of a verb, particularly with respect to the expression and interpretation of its arguments, is to a large extent determined by its meaning." However, Levin's work in practice uses form to establish classes, not meaning. This approach is followed here.] Although I also believe that many alternations, including diatheses, mostly behave sensibly, I would also warn not to expect too much regular (semantic) generalisations hidden in grammatical structure. Many grammatical regularities have unexpected exceptions, be it because of haphazard diachronic change or through creative analogical extension. Even stronger, some grammatical marking appears to be almost completely without (semantic) rationale, like the assignment of plural allomorphy in German. If that can happen in morphology, it can also happen in syntax.

As a practical approach to the domain of application of a specific alternation (say, which verbs allow for the *werden* passive, or for the reflexive anticausative, etc.), I propose to always first enumerate as much examples as possible. In other words, first inductively establish an empirical verb class of those verbs that happen to be attested. In this book, I will not be satisfied with four or five cases that suggest a neat semantic coherence for a specific diathesis, but list as many as possible further examples, idiosyncratic as they may be. Only after such a formal listing of the domain of application (which ideally needs much more corpus research than I have been able to perform here) is it possible to investigate the presence of any (semantic) rationale. In many cases there might be a partial rationale, but it is just as likely (and just as interesting) to have to conclude that there apparently is none.

Taking this principle one step further, I propose to *define* the domain of application as the concrete listing of all examples. Any (semantic) characterisation is then always a post-hoc generalisation, not a definition. This radically lexicalist interpretation is the approach that I will follow in this book. For each diathesis I will list as many as possible example verbs that take part in the diatheses (for some I will reverse the approach and list verbs that are not part of the domain of application). These lexical lists (i.e. the empirical verb classes) are the definition of the domain of application. For some diatheses, I will speculate about semantic generalisations, but I consider these generalisations always to be secondary to the concrete listing of examples.

This principle of the definition by listing even holds for questions of productivity. For example, when somebody would propose a nonce-verb like *flurchten* to be a new verb for the German language in an experimental setting, then its meaning is partially defined by stating what kind of diatheses it can take part in. Depending on how such a new verb is contextualised, the following construction might or might not be judged grammatical. The choices that will be made influence the meaning of the verb.

::: ex
a. Ich flurchte den X.
b. Ich flurchte an den X.
c. Ich flurchte mich vor den X.
d. Der X flurchtet.
e. Der X flurchtet sich.
:::

### Functional analysis {#sec:intro-functional-analysis}

Intimately connected to the domain of application (i.e. which verbs allow for which diathesis) is the question as to the meaning/function of a specific diathesis. In essence, this question asks for a description of the difference between the meaning of the two alternants of a diathesis. For example, what is the difference between the transitive [@next a] and the corresponding reflexive anticausative [@next b], see [@sec:reflexive-anticausative]. Although this might seem obvious for some diatheses, it turns out to be extremely difficult to give a concise description of such differences for most diatheses, and I will mostly refrain from trying to provide such descriptions. Each diathesis is actually its own research project, preferably investigated using predictive corpus analysis [cf. the large literature on the English dative alternation, for German see e.g. @devaere2018]. 

::: ex
a. Ich schließe die Tür.
b. Die Tür schließt sich. 
:::

There are two empirical pieces of information that are crucial for such a functional analysis of a diathesis. The first key datapoint is the actual lists of verbs that allow for a specific diathesis (i.e. the verb class as defined by a diathesis, see [@sec:intro-domain-of-application]). The second important consideration is any restriction on the kind of nominals that can be used to fill the roles of a diathesis (i.e. nominal classes as defined by a diathesis). Both these classes can be established empirically by collecting and analysing a corpus of examples for a specific diathesis.

The problem of a functional description for a diathesis becomes even more difficult with the realisation that there are many dozens of diatheses, often highly similar to each other. For example, it is really difficult [cf. @schafer2007; @kurogo2016] to characterise the difference between the reflexive anticausative above in [@last] and the unmarked anticausative in [@next], see [@sec:case-haben-anticausative].

::: ex
a. Ich koche den Kaffee.
b. Der Kaffee kocht.
:::

The problem of providing a concise functional description for a grammatical construction is not restricted to diatheses. For example, clause alternation that do not have any role-remapping are (by definition) no diatheses, but they are still discussed in the .4 sections of each chapter (they will be called 'epitheses') and are also in need of a functional description. An example is the phenomenon of 'free' reflexives [@next], see [@sec:reflexive-free-dative-sich-accusative]. Although there is no role-remapping in this alternation (and thus no diathesis), it turns out to be really difficult to describe the difference between [@next a] and [@next b]. All clause alternations, with or without role-remapping, are in need of a functional analysis, and most such analyses will involve substantial research.

## Method

Methodologically, I see the approach in this book as an attempt to unify grammatical research with lexicographic research, two aspects of linguistics that are often considered to be separate inquiries. In contrast to such a separation, I would like to propose a view of linguistics that might be called ~~grammar of the lexicon~~ [cf. @levin1993: 2-4, but one might just as well include all of construction grammar here]. In this approach, each grammatical phenomenon should always be linked to individual occurrences, either types (lexicon) or tokens (corpus). It is my experience from compiling the current compendium of diatheses that identifying and characterising a specific structure is really just 'step one' of grammatical research. Only by trying to find more examples, with different lexemes and in different contexts, it becomes clear how prominent and varying a grammatical structure really is.

As as rule-of-thumb, I propose the ~~10-in-10-rule~~ as 'step two' of grammatical research. If you think that a particular construction is widespread, or maybe typical for a specific class of words (e.g. typical for 'intransitives'), then take 10 minutes to search for examples, either in your own intuitions or in one of the many online databases or corpora. Resources like the *Digitales Wörterbuch der deutschen Sprache* ([DWDS](https://www.dwds.de)), the various online offerings of the *Institut für Deutsche Sprache* ([IDS](https://www1.ids-mannheim.de/onlineangebote)), or just a Google 'exact search' are really just a click away and completely rejuvenate linguistic research. If you are not able to list 10 examples in 10 minutes, then go back to the drawing board and reconsider your intuitions.

Such a quick-and-dirty 10-minute survey of course still only represents a preliminary step. It is this level of detail that I have aimed for in this book. Each sub-subsection about an individual diathesis lists lexemes that can be used in this diathesis, and includes examples of the diathesis, either from my own intuitions or from any of the above mentioned databases. I plan to fine-tune these lists in future revisions of this book, but the real research is only yet to come. Next steps would be the in-depth investigation of individual diathesis by sampling examples in corpora and formulating predictive parameters to explain their usage. For example, De Vaere *et al.* [-@devaere2018] investigate the dative antipassive (see [@sec:prepositions-dative-antipassive-accusative]) for just a single lexeme *geben*. As there are hundreds of diatheses and hundreds of verbs listed in this book, this shows that there are tens of thousands of similar such research projects just waiting to be tackled.

## Previous research

The current attempt to present an all-encompassing survey of German diatheses builds on a rich scholarly tradition (with many scholarly precursors to be cited in appropriate places throughout this work). A comparable and highly influential survey of diathesis for English is Levin [-@levin1993], followed by a similar attempt for German by Sauerland [-@sauerland1994]. A recent cross-linguistic survey of valency and diathesis in this tradition is edited by Malchukov & Comrie [-@malchukov2015a], which also includes data on German [@haspelmath2013a]. Independent of Levin's work, there is a long tradition in the German grammatical literature to investigate diathesis, e.g. as '*Konversenverhältnis der Aktanten*' [@eroms1980: 24; cf. @heringer1968]. An early attempt at a survey of various diatheses is presented by Höhle [-@hohle1978]. Basic summaries of german diathesis in the context of valency can be found in Eroms [-@eroms2000: Ch. 10] or Ágel [-@agel2000: Ch. 6]. There also are a few monographs about specific German diatheses [e.g. @leirbukt1997; @holl2010; @jager2013] and recently some corpus studies into the effect of specific diatheses on individual verbs have appeared [@devaere2018; @imo2018; @dux2020: Ch. 6].

Diathesis is of course closely linked to the concept of valency, so the groundbreaking valency dictionary for German by Helbig and Schenkel [-@helbig1991] deserves mentioning. They identify the problem that certain verbs can be used in different constructions, but diatheses are not investigated consistently in their dictionary. Another highly influential valency dictionary for German, edited by Schumacher [-@schumacher1986; also the precursor @engel1978], discusses passive diatheses for all verb. I see the current survey of German diatheses as a first step in extending such valency dictionaries into even more all-encompassing dictionaries that discuss all possible clause constructions for each verb.

## Structure of this book

The structure of this book is somewhat unusual for a scholarly monograph. It is not a narrative with a painless beginning, a sturdy middle and a satisfying conclusion. Rather, this book is open ended, and it does not have a gratifying closure at the end. That is by design. It is an encyclopaedia after all.

The book consists of three different parts. First, Chapter 1 and 2 discuss the major theoretical considerations that guide the collection and organisation of the data. This is the part to read for insights into the nature of diathesis and sundry topics. Second, Chapter 3 and 4 are the closest that this book has to offer in the way of a conclusion. Each of these chapters present an astonishingly long list of grammatical constructions, summarising major linguistic structures as identified in the rest of the book. These summaries are intended to be a quick entry into the actual German language data, with ample cross-references to the following encyclopaedia. Finally, Chapter 5 to 13 make up the actual encyclopaedia, with separate sub-subsections about individual phenomena. Each of these sub-subsections is a fragment of a research project, sometimes mundane, but often full of surpising avenues for future research. 

Going through the chapters in more detail, this first chapter summarised the basic definitional properties of diathesis. The next Chapter [-@sec:structure] describes in detail how diatheses are analysed and classified. Chapter [-@sec:summary] presents a summary of the about 80 major German diatheses and proposes German names for those structures. As a small extra, Chapter [-@sec:epithesis] summarises all about 40 non-diathetical structures and provides an unconventional approach to the analysis of verbal categories of German. Chapters [-@sec:case] to [-@sec:zuminfinitive] are the core part of this book. These chapter are database-like texts, discussing each clause structure separately. All of these chapters have exactly the same internal structure. Sometimes certain sections are empty, because there is no grammatical structure in that category. However, the headers of those empty sections have been preserved for the sake of parallel numbering across chapters. The following structure is used in all data chapters:

- Section X.1 is a concise introduction into the kind of diatheses discussed.
- Section X.2 is a detailed discussion of the grammatical definitions.
- Section X.3 lists examples that look like a diathesis, but there is no alternation.
- Section X.4 lists alternation with the relevant structure, but there is no diathesis.
- Section X.5 lists diatheses with subject demotion.
- Section X.6 lists diatheses with subject promotion.
- Section X.7 lists diatheses with object demotion.
- Section X.8 lists diatheses with object promotion.
- Section X.9 lists symmetrical diatheses that do not fit into the above categories.

In these data chapters, each diathesis has its own sub-subsection with an unique section header that can be used as a name to refer to the diathesis (e.g. [@sec:participles-werden-passive] on the "*werden+Partizip* passive"). Many of these unique names are quite boring, but hopefully descriptively useful for future reference. Individual verbs (often with concrete examples) are listed with each diathesis to show the extend of its applicability. Neither these lists of verbs nor the examples are intended to be exhaustive in any way. They should be seen as a first step towards more in-depth research into individual diatheses or into the different constructional possibilities that exist for individual verbs.
