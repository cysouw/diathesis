# Introduction

## Introducing diathesis

The typical example of a diathesis that will be found in virtually every grammatical descriptions of German, is the *werden + Infinitiv* passive \Next[a]. The special characteristic of such a passive is that the state-of-affairs is basically the same as in the corresponding active \Next[b], though the sentence structure of course differs between the two.

\ex.
 \a. Ein Gemälde wird (von den Künstler) gemalt.
 \b. Der Künstler malt ein Gemälde.

This approach to diathesis, viz. different sentence constructions that express the same situation, is applicable to an enormous number of grammatical phenomena in German. For example, some verbs allow for passive-like constructions without any auxiliary like *werden* \Next[a], or allow for a change between a case-marked and a prepositional argument \Next[b]. Further, there exist many different diatheses with reflexive pronouns \Next[c] or with preverbs \Next[d]. And various auxiliary-like construction beyond the *werden* passive also show diathesis \Next[e]. \footnote{Many examples in this book include masculine nouns because their articles overtly show the different cases. Notwithstanding this grammatical argument, I will try to use examples with as much diversity as possible.}

\ex.
 \a. Der Doktor heilt den Schmerz. Der Schmerz heilt (durch den Doktor).
 \b. Der Jäger schießt den Bären. Der Jäger schießt auf den Bären.
 \c. Der Lehrer beklagt den Lärm. Der Lehrer beklagt sich über den Lärm.
 \d. Der Kandidat stammt aus einem Adelsgeschlecht. Der Kandidat entstammt einem Adelsgeslecht
 \e. Der Ermittler löst den Fall. Der Fall ist (für den Ermittler) leicht zu lösen.



#### Valency

Valency is traditionally interpreted as a fixed constructional characteristic of a lexical verb, e.g. the verb *geben* 'to give' is said to be ditransitive. A central thesis of this book is that this conception of valency is misguided.

- valency of a construction: most (all?) lexical verbs can appear in multiple constructions with different valencies
- valency of a lexical verb: collection of all constructional valencies with links between them
- lexical roles: links between valencies. Lexical roles are not purely semantic: they only count as a lexical role given certain grammatical characteristics. Lexical roles are not necessarily translatable! 


Valency: is this really a characteristic of a verb? Most (all?) verbs seem to allow for multiple valencies. There is a strong tendency to try to reduce this variation to a single valency per verb (the 'real' valency), and various strategies are employed to arrive at such a prototypical valency (see e.g. [@welke2011: Ch. 9] for different approaches).

## Defining diathesis

A diathesis is defined here as special kind of alternation of two different clause constructions. To properly define the notion 'diathesis', I will first define 'alternation' in general. The definition of 'clause alternation' will be built on that basis. Finally, a diathesis will be defined as special kind of clause alternation.

An \textsc{alternation} (or simply 'grammatical marking') is defined as follows:

- An alternation consist of two different linguistic constructions, i.e. there are two **alternants**.
- The lexical root does not change in the alternation, i.e. there is some linguistic material in both alternants that remains the same.
- The difference between these alternants is overtly indicated by the presence of some grammatical linguistic elements.
- Typically, the overt marking introduces a **direction** into the alternation, i.e. one alternant consists of less/shorter/zero linguistic elements ('less marked') and one consists of more/longer/overt linguistic material ('more marked').
- In some cases, the direction of the alternation remains undecidable, i.e. the alternation is **equipollent**.

Alternations are the basis of all grammatical analysis. It includes for example (i) morphological oppositions like singular *Haus* 'house' vs. plural *Häuser* 'houses'; (ii) different grammatical forms like synthetic present *er schläft* 'he sleeps' vs. analytic perfect *er hat geschlafen* 'he has slept'; or (iii) different sentence constructions attested with specific verbs, like transitive *Ich verkaufe das Buch* 'I sell the book' vs. reflexive anticausative with obligatory adverbial *Das Buch verkauft sich gut* 'the book is selling well'.

Based on this definition of an alternation, a \textsc{clause alternation} is defined as follows:

- In a clause alternation **both alternants are monoclausal**, i.e. both alternants contain a single main predicate. For German, the main argument for monoclausality will be a phenomenon called 'coherence'.
- In both alternants, the **main predicate consists of the same lexeme**, i.e both contain the same verb.
- The **meaning of the verb does not change*** (substantially) between the alternants.
- The **lexical roles of the verb do not change** between the alternants. Note, however, that there might be new roles introduced or some roles might be left unexpressed.
- A specific clause alternation is only applicable to a restricted set of verbs. The list of applicable verbs constitutes the **domain of application** of the alternation. Any semantic/syntactic characterisation of these applicable verbs should be seen as a summary of the domain of application, not its definition.

Clause alternations are widespread when auxiliaries are introduced, like modal *müssen* 'have to' \Next[a]. Yet, clause alternation are attested with various different markings, like the verb particle *auf* marking completeness of the action \Next[b] or the somewhat mysterious reflexive *sich* with verbs like *ansehen* 'look at' \Next[c]. Arguably, the special word order in German subordinate clauses (viz. the finite verb occurs clause-final) can be considered a clause alternation.

\ex.
 \a. Er erledigt seine Hausaufgaben. Er muss seine Hausaufgaben erledigen.
 \b. Ich esse den Apfel. Ich esse den Apfel auf.
 \c. Er hat das Haus angesehen. Er hat sich das Haus angesehen.
 \d. Er erledigt seine Hausaufgaben. Ich hoffe, dass er seine Hausaufgaben erledigt

Based on the notion of a clause alternation, a \textsc{diathesis} (or 'valency alternation', I use both terms synonymously) is defined as follows:

- A diathesis is a clause alternation in which at least one of the lexical roles is overtly marked differently between the clausal alternants, i.e. **at least one of the roles is reframed** (i.e. there is a role-marking alternation).
- Reframed roles do not substantially change their meaning, i.e. **'who does what to whom' does not change**.
- The details of the relation between the main predicate and the reframed roles can (and normally will) change, e.g. there will be changes in aspects like the role's influence on the action or its affectedness by the predicate.
- As an extreme case, the reframing of a role might consist in the **addition** of a completely new role or in the **complete removal** of an existing role.
- As is true for all alternations, a diathesis has a **direction** from a formally 'less marked' to a 'more marked' alternant. However, in some special instances a diathesis can show no other overt marking than the change in marking of the reframed roles itself, i.e. a **bare diathesis** (or 'equipollent' diathesis).

The prototypical example of a diathesis is the *werden + Partizip* passive \Next[a]. In both clause alternants the same state of affairs is described, but the marking of the participants is different. However, the diversity of diatheses in German is enormous as this book attempts to show. There are, for example, bare diatheses (i.e. diatheses without any marking on the verb) like the infamous anticausative in \Next[b] or antipassives marked with a reflexive pronouns as shown in \Next[c].

\ex.
 \a. Der Schreiner hat den Tisch angemalt. Der Tisch wurde von den Schreiner angemalt.
 \b. Ich koche den Kaffee. Der Kaffee kocht.
 \c. Der Fahrradfahrer fürchtet den Anstieg. Der Fahrradfahrer fürchtet sich vor den Anstieg.

## Definitional details

Hidden in the succinct definition of diathesis from the previous section there are various intricate grammatical concepts that need some more explanation.

- Monoclausality and coherence: Classifying a multi-verb sentence as a single clause.
- Grammaticalisation of lexical meaning: One phonological root can be different lexemes.
- Lexical roles: Roles are primarily lexeme-specific; semantic roles are clusters of lexical roles.
- Domain of application: Form-based lexical classes are the crucial empirical evidence of grammatical theory.

#### Monoclausality and coherence {.unnumbered}

One of the crucial characteristics of the syntax of German is that the finite verb is moved to the end of the sentence in a subordinate clauses. I will use the dummy main sentence *Es ist bekannt, dass* 'it is known that' to force a subordinate construction. The position of the finite verb in the subordinate clause can be used the identify the boundary of the clause: everything that can occur before the finite verb belongs to the clause; everything that has to come after the finite verb belongs to a different clause. For example, the simple sentence \Next[a] will turn into \Next[b] as a subordinate clause, with the finite verb at the end; \Next[c] is not possible (with any constituent after the finite verb), so the whole sentence in \Next[a] is a single clause. Constructions such with a pattern will be called \textsc{coherent}, following Bech [-@bech1955]; see also Kiss [-@kiss1995] for a more in-depth and more extensive discussion of the concept 'coherence'. Coherent constructions are considered to be \textsc{monoclausal}.

\ex.
 \a.    Ich gehe morgen nach Hause.
 \b.    Es ist bekannt, dass ich morgen nach Hause gehe.
 \c. \* Es ist bekannt, dass ich gehe morgen nach Hause.

Exactly the same coherence is attested in auxiliary constructions with participles \Next and infinitives \NNext. Such constructions are also monoclausal.

\ex.
 \a.    Ich habe gestern ein Haus gekauft.
 \b.    Es ist bekannt, dass ich gestern ein Haus gekauft habe.
 \c. \* Es ist bekannt, dass ich gestern gekauft habe ein Haus.

\ex.
 \a.    Ich will morgen ein Haus kaufen.
 \b.    Es ist bekannt, dass ich morgen ein Haus kaufen will.
 \c. \* Es ist bekannt, dass ich morgen kaufen will ein Haus.

Constructions with *zu* and infinitive are sometimes coherent, e.g. \Next with finite verb *gibt*, and sometimes not coherent, e.g. \NNext with finite verb *hofft*. The coherent construction in \Next[a] is thus monoclausal, while the non-coherent construction in \NNext[a] consists of two clauses.

\ex.
 \a.    Der Protest gibt ihr zu denken.
 \b.    Es ist bekannt, dass der Protest ihr zu denken gibt.
 \c. \* Es ist bekannt, dass der Protest gibt ihr zu denken.

\ex.
 \a.    Der Sportler hofft den Wettkampf zu gewinnen.
 \b. \* Es ist bekannt, dass der Sportler den Wettkampf zu gewinnen hofft.
 \c.    Es ist bekannt, dass der Sportler hofft den Wettkampf zu gewinnen.

In some intermediate cases both orders are possible, as shown in \Next. These constructions will be called 'semi-coherent' here.

\ex.
 \a.    Ich helfe dir den Koffer zu tragen.
 \b.    Es ist bekannt, dass ich dir helfe den Koffer zu tragen.
 \c.    Es ist bekannt, dass ich dir den Koffer zu tragen helfe.

#### Grammaticalisation of lexical meaning {.unnumbered}

A difficult problem is the question whether it is really the same verb that is used in two different alternating constructions. For example, the verb *trinken* 'to drink' is a regular transtive verb, but when used intransitively, *er trinkt* 'he drinks', it has a clear implication that his drinking includes too much alcohol, so it might be better translated as 'he is an alcoholic'. In this case, this intransitive interpretation is probably best analysed as a conventional implicature, because the alcoholism aspect of the meaning can be suppressed given the right context.

In general, when the same lexical verb is used in different alternating constructions, then there is (of course) a difference in meaning between the two occurrences. However, ideally this difference is completely induced by the respective constructions and not by the lexical verb itself. Yet, it is extremely common for the combination of a lexical element with the surrounding construction to grammaticalise into a new meaning. For example, the verb *auftreten* means something like 'to act' as an intransitive, but *to kick open* as a transitive. Both meanings originate from the meaning 'to step on something (by foot)'. Likewise, historical processes can lead to current homophony of two different lexemes. This appears to be the case for example with the verb *abhauen*, which is a transitive verb meaning 'cut of' (e.g. *Er hat den Ast abgehauen*). However, it has attained another usage during the course of the 20th Century as an intransitive verb meaning 'run away' (e.g. *Er ist abgehauen*), probably based on a southern German dialectal meaning of *hauen* meaning 'to go, to walk' [@pfeiffer1993: "hauen", accessed 12.12.2018].

In between those extremes (i.e. conventional implicature and different lexicalisation) there exist various intermediate phenomena. For example, the verb *hängen* 'to hang' can be used as a regular intransitive verb with a location, like *Er hängt an einem Seil* 'He dangles to a rope', but the specific combination with the preposition *an* can also have a special reading of 'being emotionally attached to something', like in *Er hängt an seinem Teddy* 'He is (emotionally) attached to his Teddy'. In this case it seems most appropriate to interpret the combination *hängen an* as a separate lexicalisation.

As with all grammaticalisation processes, it is difficult to decide where to draw the line on the continuum between conventional implicature or metaphorical extension (*trinken*) and contextual lexicalisation (*hängen an*) or completely different lexicalisation (*auftreten*, *abhauen*). I tend to be rather lenient in allowing slightly different meanings to be included as the 'same' verb, but will excluded the latter two types on the continuum as separate lexicalisations of homophonous elements.

#### Lexical roles {.unnumbered}

roles, not arguments!

Of crucial importance for the description of diathesis is the proper identification of lexically governed constituents, i.e. the arguments of a clausal predicate ('verb'). Intuitively, the arguments of a predicate are those roles/participants that are inherently part of the meaning of the lexeme. For example, a verb like 'to accuse' implies the presence of an accuser, an accussee and an accusation. However, a purely introspective semantic determination of such lexical roles is fraught with unverifiable intuitive decisions. A widespread idea is that for a constituent to be an inherent argument, the consituent in question should be invoked specifically by the lexical predicate and not have an adjunct status available to every predicate throughout the language. Yet, this intuition of a difference between arguments and adjuncts has to be operationalised in more detail. As an operationalisation, I propose to determine the arguments of a predicate based on a series of form-based structural arguments, to be detailed below. Note that these arguments are specifically tailored to the German language structure and cannot integrally be translated to other languages.

Basically, there are three kinds of constituents with argument status in German. They will quickly be introduced here and then discussed in more detail in Chapter [-@sec:case]. First, all case marked noun phrase constituents are arguments (with a few exceptions that will be discussed below). Case marked constituent \Next[a] can be questioned by question pronouns *wer* or *was*, including their case forms *wem*, *wen* and *wessen* \Next[b,c]. Further, they can be pronominalised by personal pronouns \Next[d] or indefine pronouns *(irgend)jemand* or *(irgend)etwas* \Next[e].

\ex.
 \a. Der Löwe sieht einen Vogel.
 \b. Wer sieht einen Vogel?
 \c. Was sieht der Löwe?
 \d. Er sieht ihn.
 \e. Jemand sieht etwas.

Second, prepositional phrases \Next[a] are arguments if and only if they can be pronominalised by *da(r)+preposition* \Next[b], questioned by *wo(r)+preposition* \Next[c], or even more telling, replaced by a complement clause of the form *da(r)+preposition, dass ...* \Next[d]. A few exceptional cases will be discussed below.

\ex.
 \a. Der Weltreisende wartet auf einen Zug.
 \b. Der Weltreisende wartet darauf.
 \c. Worauf wartet der Weltreisende?
 \d. Der Weltreisende wartet darauf, dass ein Zug kommt.

Third, all complement clauses are arguments (a,b). Complement clauses can be questioned by *was* (c) and pronominalised by a definite pronoun *es* (d) or an indefinite pronoun *(irgend)etwas* (e). Complement clauses are thus syntactically highly similar to case marked noun phrases. Caution should be taken when interpreting pronominalised examples like (d,e), because it is not immediately obvious whether the pronouns are replacing a noun phrase or a complement clause. For example, with the verb *hoffen* (e) it is not possible to replace the pronoun *etwas* with a noun phrase, in contrast to the verb *sehen* above.

(a) Er hofft, dass er rechtzeitig kommt.
(b) Er hofft rechtzeitig zu kommen.
(c) Was hofft er?
(d) Er hofft es.
(e) Er hofft etwas.

#### Domain of application {.unnumbered}

## Classifying diatheses

In the discussion of the various diatheses in German, I will classify them into different kinds of diatheses. This classification is not a definitional issue, but purely a practical organizational device. It might very well turn out that some of these classifications is not ideal, i.e. that some alternation is better considered as belonging to a different kind. However, such a reorganization would not change anything about the diatheses themselves.

The different kinds of diatheses distinguished here have a long history in the typological literature [cf. @wunderlich1993; @wunderlich2015; @dixon2000a; @dixon2014; @haspelmath2004c; @malchukov2015: 96ff.]


- **PASSIVE: Promotion of a non-nominative argument to subject.** The typical characteristic of a passive is a non-nominatively case-marked role to being 'more important', typically becoming the subject (i.e. nominative + verb agreement). The original subject can optionally be retained as an non-nominative case or a prepositional phrase. In general, the original subject is still understood to be some kind of agent in the passive alternant.
- **ANTICAUSATIVE: Removal of a causer from subject.** The typical characteristic of an anticausative is the removal of the nominative subject which causes the action/state of the clause. Filling the gap, any non-nominative argument is promoted to subject. Note that in effect, such an alternation is highly similar to a passive. The main difference (which is often difficult to decide) is that for a passive the original subject is still implied (and can be overtly expressed), while for an anticausative the original subject is completely removed (e.g. a phrase like "by itself" can typically be added).

- **INVERTED PASSIVE**
- **CAUSATIVE: Addition of a new causer as subject.** The typical characteristic of a causative is the addition of a new nominative subject which causes the action/state as described in the original clause. The original nominative is typically retained as a non-nominative argument.
- **EXPERIENCER/BENEFACTIVE: addition of new subject with different role.**

- **REVERSAL: subject and object switch.** [@malchukov2015: 99-100]


- **ANTIAPPLICATIVE (ANTIPASSIVE): Demotion of a non-nominative argument to prepositional phrase.** The typical characteristic of an antipassive is a non-nominatively case-marked role to being marked as 'less important', typically becoming a prepositional phrase. The complete removal of this role can be seen as an extreme form of an antipassive, though I mostly classify such a removal separately as a **drop** of an argument.
- **APPLICATIVE: Addition of a new non-nominative argument.** The typical characteristic of an applicative is the introduction of a new non-nominatively marked role. Typically, a new role is marked as an accusative and the original accusatively marked role is encoded differently. It is also possible that the new role is not replacing any existing marking, but simply added to the argument structure of a verb. However, I will classify such completely new roles mostly as an **addition** of an argument.

- **RESULTATIVE: Addtion of a new causee as a non-nominative argument.** The typical characteristic of a resultative is the addition of a new causee. Instead of simply expressing the content of a predicate as the action/state of the clause, a resultative diatheses expressed that something is caused by performing the predicate.
- **ANTIRESULTATIVE**
- **POSSESSOR RAISING: possessor of an argument becomes a separate argument.**

- **OBJECT REVERSAL**

- **DROP** "deobjective" [@haspelmath2004c: 1131]
- **ADDITION**


Note that the term "resultative" is used by [@nedjalkov1988a] with a different meaning (viz. a special kind of anticausative)

Note: "active" is not a diathesis!

First use of "antipassive": [@silverstein1972: 395], known as 'deaccusative' [@geniusiene1987: 94] and antiapplicative [@haspelmath2004c: 1132]

=> check [@haspelmath2004c]

drop is named "antipassive" in [@scheibl2006: 372-373] and antipassive is called 'antiapplicative' [@scheibl2006: 371]

## Further grammatical topics

### Obligatory pronoun 'es'

Another pronoun that plays an important role in the marking of diathesis is *es*, the 3rd person nominative/accusative pronoun in the neutrum gender. There are three main uses of this pronoun, and only the third is relevant for the current discussion. First, 'es' is used for anaphoric reference to neutrum nouns, as shown in (a). There are various other variants of such 'phoric' usage, for example without direct gender agreement (Czicza 2014: Ch. 2).

Second, the pronoun 'es' is also used to fill the first sentence position in front of the finite verb ('Vorfeld' in German grammatical terminology), because there is a strong regularity in German that this position can not be left empty (except in imperatives and yes/no questions). Word order is rather flexible in German, and it is often possible to have no lexical content in the Vorfeld. In such cases, the pronoun 'es' can be used to fill the Vorfeld, as shown in (b). This is known as a position-simulating *es* (Czicza 2014: 115).

Finally, there are also constructions that obligatorily include the pronoun 'es' in the sentence. This happens because there is a strong regularity in German that the subject has to be present in each sentence ('pro drop' is not possible). Note that 'subject' is defined here for German as the noun phrase that shows agreement with the finite verb (see next section). When there is no subject available, then the pronoun 'es' can be used to fill this gap. In such constructions, as exemplified in (c,d), the pronoun 'es' often occurs in the Vorfeld (c), seemingly parallel to the Vorfeld-filling usage (b). However, When another constituent is placed in the Vorfeld, this obligatory 'es' cannot be removed completely, but has to occur elsewher in the sentence, typicaly immediately after the finite verb (d). This is known as a valency-simulating *es* (Czicza 2014: 115).

(a) Das Mädchen weint. Ich tröste es. (Referential or 'phoric' usage)
(b) Es weint ein Mädchen. (Optional 'position-simulating' usage to fill the Vorfeld)
(c) Es stinkt hier sehr. (Construction with obligatory 'es')
(d) Hier stinkt es sehr. (Obligatory 'es' remains when Vorfeld is filled)

This obligatory valency-simulating 'es' can be replaced by a question word 'was' in questions (a) or the demonstrative 'das' in exclamations (b).

(a) Was stinkt denn hier?
(b) Das stinkt hier aber!

Sometimes quantifiers also seem possible to replace a valency-simulating *es* (a,b).

(a) Hier dreht es sich um ihn.
(b) Hier dreht sich alles um ihn.

Another kind of phoric *es* occurs with some predicates that allow for a non-finite complement clause. In most such predicates, the complement clause replaces the argument (a), but in some cases a pronoun *es* remains in place of the original argument (b,c). This is known as a 'correlative' *es* Czicza 2014: 79ff.).

(a) Ich versuche [schnell zu laufen].
(b) Ich hasse es [schnell zu laufen].
(c) Mir gefällt es [schnell zu laufen].

In a very limited set of constructions 'es' is left out completely, resulting in sentences without a syntactic subject (a-e).

(a) Heute ist mir kalt.
(b) Dem Mörder graut vor Blut.
(c) Mich dürstet. (old fashioned)
(d) Mir liegt viel an deiner Anwesenheit.
(e) Jetzt wird geschlafen! (impersonal passive)

=> obligatory non-referential non-nominative *es* ???: 

*sie hatte es auf ihn angelegt*
*er hat es absichtlich darauf angelegt, ihm zu schaden*
*sie vermochte es nicht den Unfall zu verhindern*. (altmodisch?)
*Sie lehnt es ab zu kommen*

### Finite verbforms

Each German sentence needs at least one finite verbform, which is inflected for person, number and tense. The person inflection agrees in person and number with the subject. However, it is probably better to reverse this defintion, in that the 'subject' can be defined as the noun phrase that shows agreement with the finite verb. To ease the identification of the finite verb, I will only use singular forms in the present tense in all constructed examples. In most cases, these forms can readily be identified by their suffixes (see Table, showing the most important inflection classes and irregular verbs.)

| Person | Weak verbs | Verbs with Umlaut | Verbs with Vokalwechsel | Modalverben (e.g. können) | haben | werden | sein
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- 
| 1st person | kauf-e | lauf-e | geb-e | kann | hab-e | werd-e | bin
| 2nd person | kauf-st | läuf-st | gib-st | kann-st | ha-st | wir-st | bist
| 3rd person | kauf-t | läuf-t | gib-t | kann | ha-t | wird | ist

### Light verbs

There is a large group of verbs in German that shed much of their lexical meaning in certain constructions. Such grammaticalised verbs are referred to by many different names in the German grammatical literature, e.g. Hilfsverb, Kopulaverb, Modalverb, Modalitätsverb, Halbmodalverb (Eisenberg), Funktionsverb (Polenz 1963 cited in Kamber 2008:34), Strukturverb (Weber 2005), or Stützverb (Seelbach 1991 cited in Kamber 2008:34). The debate how to classify these verbs into groups will not be pursued here. Therefore, I will simply refer to the whole group of such verbs as 'light verbs'. The most important light verbs, which will all be discussed here, are shown in alphabetical order in (). It is a difficult issue to decide in a specific sentence whether such a verb is used as a full lexical verb or as a light verb. These verbs show a continuum of more or less grammaticalised uses. As a general desideratum, semantic arguements do not suffice to distinguish light verb usage. There need to be structural differences between the light verb and full verb constructions to claim such a differentiation.

- *bekommen, bleiben, brauchen, bringen, drohen, dürfen, fahren, geben, gehen, gelten, geraten, haben, heißen, klappen, kommen, kriegen, können, lassen, machen, möchten, mögen, müssen, nehmen, pflegen, scheinen, sehen, sein, sollen, stehen, stellen, tun, versprechen, werden, wissen, wollen*

### Sentence blueprints

For the analysis of German sentence, it is useful to distinguish five different nonverbal predication structures, as shown in Table (). I will refer to these structures as 'sentence blueprints'. These constructions use one of the many light verb together with a non-verbal main predicate.

| Blueprint | Example | Predication construction
| --- | --- | ---
| Adjectival blueprint | Ich bin jung/unterwegs. | Adjectival/adverbial predication
| Bare nominal blueprint | Ich bin Tourist. | Nominal predication, no article, no preposition
| Full nominal blueprint | Ich bin ein Tourist. | Nominal predication, with article, no preposition
| Bare prepositional blueprint | Ich bin auf Weltreise. | Nominal predication, no article, with preposition
| Full prepositional blueprint | Ich bin auf einer Weltreise. | Nominal predication, with article, with preposition

=> 'haben'+Noun predicate: Ich habe Hunger/Durst/Angst/Langeweile/Sehnsucht/Lust/Recht/Geduld

The lexical predicate in nonverbal blueprints can also be filled with a derivational verbform, as shown in Table (). Typically, German participles and infinitives are used, because participles are functionally similar to adjectives and infinitives are similar to nouns. These five verb-filled blueprints are an extension of the three different kinds of 'Statusrektion' that have a long tradition in the German grammatical literature (originating with Bech 1955). The bare nominal blueprint corresponds to the so-called 'first status', the bare prepositional blueprint to the 'second status' and the adjectival blueprint to the 'third status'. For mnemonic reasons, I prefer the iconic names as proposed in the table below over abstract numerical representations.

| Blueprint | Example | Derived verbform
| --- | --- | ---
| Adjectival blueprint | Ich bin gekommen. | Participle, or other adjective-like derived verb
| Bare nominal blueprint | Ich bin spazieren. | Infinitive, or other noun-like derived verb
| Full nominal blueprint | Ich habe ein Flimmern im Auge. | Article with infinitive, or other noun-like derived verb
| Bare prepositional blueprint | Ich habe zu danken. | Preposition (typically 'zu') with infinitive, or other noun-like derived verb
| Full prepositional blueprint | Ich bin beim Schwimmen. | Preposition with Article and Infinitive, or other noun-like derived verb
