# Setting the scene

## The daunting diathesis diversity

The quintessential example of diathesis, found in virtually every grammatical descriptions of German, is the *werden + Infinitiv* passive construction \Next[a]. The important characteristic of this construction is that the state-of-affairs as described by the passive is essentially the same as in the corresponding active \Next[b], though the grammatical structure of course differs between the two expressions.

\ex.
 \a. Das Gemälde wird (von einem Künstler) gemalt.
 \b. Der Künstler malt ein Gemälde.

This approach to diathesis, viz. different grammatical sentence-structures that express approximately the same situation, is applicable to a large number of grammatical phenomena in German. For example, some verbs allow for passive-like constructions without any *werden* auxiliary \Next[a], other verbs allow for an alternation between a case-marked accusative and a prepositional phrase \Next[b]. Further, there exist many different kinds of diathesis marked by a reflexive pronoun \Next[c] or marked by preverbs \Next[d]. Many auxiliary-like construction beyond the *werden* passive also show diathesis \Next[e].^[Many examples in this book contain masculine nouns, not because of laziness on my behalve, but because their definite articles overtly show the different German cases (*der, des, dem, den*). Notwithstanding this grammatical preference, I will try to use examples with as much diversity as possible throughout this book.]

\ex.
 \a. Der Doktor heilt den Schmerz. Der Schmerz heilt (durch den Doktor).
 \b. Der Jäger schießt den Bären. Der Jäger schießt auf den Bären.
 \c. Der Lehrer beklagt den Lärm. Der Lehrer beklagt sich über den Lärm.
 \d. Der Kandidat stammt aus einem Adelsgeschlecht. Der Kandidat entstammt einem Adelsgeschlecht
 \e. Der Ermittler löst den Fall. Der Fall ist (für den Ermittler) leicht zu lösen.

All in all, there are about 200 different diatheses described in this book, some highly productive, some only attested with a handful of verbs. The main goal of this book is to present this wealth of grammatical possibility in a unified manner, while at the same time attempting to classify and organise this diversity. There is no attempt made to fit all these constructional possibilities of the German language into any specific grammatical framework, but by simply organising all this information there are already various generalisation popping up along the way.

It might come as a surprise that there are so many different diatheses in German, but my impression is that German is no exception among the world's languages in this respect. I expect that all languages have a wealth of different ways in which to construe a sentence around a lexical predicate. In a sense, diathesis allows for the expressions of different perspectives on the event described, something that is arguably a common desire of any language user. Looking at it this way, diathesis belongs squarely in the same domain of grammatical analysis like aspect and evidentiality.

In this book, each diathesis has its own sub-subsection with an unique section header that can be used as a name to refer to the diathesis. Many of the names are quite boring, but hopefully descriptively useful for future reference. Individual verbs (often with concrete examples) are listed with each diathesis to show the extend of its applicability. Neither these lists of verbs, nor the examples, are intended to be exhaustive in any way. They should be seen as a first step towards more in-depth research into individual diatheses or into the different constructional possibilities that exist for individual verbs.

The current attempt to present a all-encompassing survey of German diathesis builds on a rich scholarly tradition (with many scholarly precursors to be cited in appropriate places throughout this work). A comparable and highly influential survey of diathesis for English is Levin [-@levin1993], followed by a similar attempt for German by Sauerland [-@sauerland1994]. A recent cross-linguistic survey of valency and diathesis in this tradition is edited by Malchukov & Comrie [-@malchukov2015a], which also includes data on German [@haspelmath2013a]. Independent of Levin's work, there is a long tradition in the German grammatical literature to investigate diathesis, e.g. as "Konversenverhältnis der Aktanten" [@eroms1980: 24; cf. @heringer1968]. Basic summaries of german diathesis in the context of valency can be found in Eroms [-@eroms2000: Ch. 10] or Ágel [-@agel2000: Ch. 6]. There even exist a few monographies about specific German diatheses [e.g. @leirbukt1997; @holl2010; @jager2013] and recently some corpus studies into the effect of specific diatheses on individual verbs have appeared [@devaere2018; @imo2018]. 

## Defining diathesis

### Basic definition

A diathesis is defined here as special kind of alternation between two different clause constructions. To properly define the notion 'diathesis', I will first define 'alternation' in general. The definition of 'clause alternation' will be built on that basis. Finally, a diathesis will be defined as special kind of clause alternation.

An \textsc{alternation} (or simply 'grammatical marking') is defined as follows:

- An alternation consist of two different linguistic constructions, i.e. there are two **alternants**.
- The lexical root does not change in the alternation, i.e. there is some linguistic material in both alternants that remains the same.
- The difference between these alternants is overtly indicated by the presence of some grammatical linguistic elements.
- Typically, the overt marking introduces a **direction** into the alternation, i.e. one alternant consists of less/shorter/zero linguistic elements ('less marked') and one consists of more/longer/overt linguistic material ('more marked').
- In some cases, the direction of the alternation remains undecidable, i.e. the alternation is **equipollent**.

Alternations are the basis of all grammatical analysis. It includes for example (i) morphological oppositions like singular *Haus* 'house' vs. plural *Häuser* 'houses'; (ii) different grammatical forms like synthetic present *er schläft* 'he sleeps' vs. analytic perfect *er hat geschlafen* 'he has slept'; or (iii) different sentence constructions attested with specific verbs, like transitive *Ich verkaufe das Buch* 'I sell the book' vs. reflexive anticausative with obligatory adverbial *Das Buch verkauft sich gut* 'the book is selling well'.

Based on this definition of an alternation, a \textsc{clause alternation} is defined as follows:

- In a clause alternation **both alternants are monoclausal**, i.e. both alternants contain a single main predicate. For German, the main argument for monoclausality will be a phenomenon called 'coherence'.
- In both alternants, the **main predicate consists of the same lexeme**, i.e both contain the same verb.
- The **meaning of the verb does not change*** (substantially) between the alternants.
- The **lexical roles of the verb do not change** between the alternants. Note, however, that there might be new roles introduced or some roles might be left unexpressed.
- A specific clause alternation is only applicable to a restricted set of verbs. The list of applicable verbs constitutes the **domain of application** of the alternation. Any semantic/syntactic characterisation of these applicable verbs should be seen as a summary of the domain of application, not its definition.

Clause alternations are widespread when auxiliaries are introduced, like modal *müssen* 'have to' \Next[a]. Moreover, clause alternation are attested with many different kindd of marking, like the verb particle *auf* marking completeness of the action \Next[b] or the somewhat mysterious 'free' reflexive *sich* with verbs like *ansehen* 'look at' \Next[c]. Arguably, the special word order in German subordinate clauses (viz. the finite verb occurs clause-final) can also be considered to be a clause alternation.

\ex.
 \a. Er erledigt seine Hausaufgaben. Er muss seine Hausaufgaben erledigen.
 \b. Ich esse den Apfel. Ich esse den Apfel auf.
 \c. Er hat das Haus angesehen. Er hat sich das Haus angesehen.
 \d. Er erledigt seine Hausaufgaben. Ich hoffe, dass er seine Hausaufgaben erledigt

Based on the notion of a clause alternation, a \textsc{diathesis} (or 'valency alternation', I use both terms synonymously) is defined as follows:

- A diathesis is a clause alternation in which at least one of the lexical roles is overtly marked differently between the clausal alternants, i.e. **at least one of the roles is reframed** (i.e. there is a role-marking alternation).
- Reframed roles do not substantially change their meaning, i.e. **'who does what to whom' does not change**.
- The details of the relation between the main predicate and the reframed roles can (and normally will) change, e.g. there will be changes in aspects like the role's influence on the action or its affectedness by the predicate.
- As an extreme case, the reframing of a role might consist in the **addition** of a completely new role or in the **complete removal** of an existing role.
- As is true for all alternations, a diathesis has a **direction** from a formally 'less marked' to a 'more marked' alternant. However, in some special instances a diathesis can show no other overt marking than the change in marking of the reframed roles itself, i.e. a **bare diathesis** (or 'equipollent' diathesis).

The prototypical example of a diathesis is the *werden + Partizip* passive \Next[a]. In both clause alternants the same state of affairs is described, but the marking of the participants is different. However, the diversity of diatheses in German is enormous as this book attempts to show. There are, for example, bare diatheses (i.e. diatheses without any marking on the verb) like the infamous anticausative in \Next[b] or antipassives marked with a reflexive pronouns as shown in \Next[c]. I prefer the term 'diathesis' over the most equivalent term 'valency alternation, because there are various diatheses (with clearly reframed roles) in which the valency does not change between the alternants \Next[d].

\ex.
 \a. Der Schreiner hat den Tisch angemalt. Der Tisch wurde von den Schreiner angemalt.
 \b. Ich koche den Kaffee. Der Kaffee kocht.
 \c. Der Fahrradfahrer fürchtet den Anstieg. Der Fahrradfahrer fürchtet sich vor den Anstieg.
 \d. Ich schmiere Salbe auf die Wunde. Ich beschmiere die Wunde mit Salbe.

Hidden in this succinct definition of diathesis there are various intricate grammatical concepts that need some more discussion in subsequent sections:

- Monoclausality and coherence: Determining when a multi-verb sentence is a single clause by using the concept of coherence. All diatheses are monoclausal.
- Grammaticalisation of lexical meaning: One phonological root can be different lexemes, and then they are not included as diathesis.
- Lexeme-specific lexical roles: Roles are lexeme-specific and semantic roles are clusters of lexical roles.
- Domain of application: Form-based lexical classes are the crucial empirical evidence of grammatical theory. Semantic generalisations are secondary.

### Monoclausality and coherence

Diatheses are defined above as alternations between single clauses. However, a single clause in German can sometimes consist of multiple verb forms. It is crucial to strictly distinguish between when a multi-verb construction is monoclausal and when it is not. The basis of the definition of monoclausality is a concept called \textsc{coherence}.

All diatheses listed in this book are monoclausal. Additionally, I will also list all non-diathesis clause alternation, i.e monoclausal alternations without any change in sentence structure (they are always listed in the .4 section of each chapter). This book can thus also be read as a listing of all German monoclausal constructions, with or without valency change. Somewhat unexpectedly, the number of alternations without any change in valency (i.e. the alternations without diathesis) is much smaller than the monoclausal alternations with changes in role marking (i.e. the diatheses).

To define monoclausality, the crucial characteristic of German syntax is that the finite verb is moved to the end of the sentence in a subordinate clauses. I will use the dummy main sentence *Es ist bekannt, dass ...* 'it is known that' to force a subordinate construction. The position of the finite verb in the subordinate clause can be used the identify the boundary of the clause: everything that can occur before the finite verb belongs to the clause; everything that has to come after the finite verb belongs to a different clause. For example, the simple sentence \Next[a] will turn into \Next[b] as a subordinate clause, with the finite verb at the end; \Next[c] is not possible (with any constituent after the finite verb), so the whole sentence in \Next[a] is a single clause. Constructions with such a pattern will be called \textsc{coherent}, following Bech [-@bech1955]; see also Kiss [-@kiss1995] for a more in-depth and more extensive discussion of the concept 'coherence'. Coherent constructions are considered to be \textsc{monoclausal}.

\ex.
 \a.    Ich gehe morgen nach Hause.
 \b.    Es ist bekannt, dass ich morgen nach Hause gehe.
 \c. \* Es ist bekannt, dass ich gehe morgen nach Hause.

Exactly the same coherence is attested in auxiliary constructions with participles \Next and infinitives \NNext. Such constructions are also monoclausal.

\ex.
 \a.    Ich habe gestern ein Haus gekauft.
 \b.    Es ist bekannt, dass ich gestern ein Haus gekauft habe.
 \c. \* Es ist bekannt, dass ich gestern gekauft habe ein Haus.

\ex.
 \a.    Ich will morgen ein Haus kaufen.
 \b.    Es ist bekannt, dass ich morgen ein Haus kaufen will.
 \c. \* Es ist bekannt, dass ich morgen kaufen will ein Haus.

Constructions with *zu* and infinitive are sometimes coherent, e.g. \Next with finite verb *gibt*, and sometimes non-coherent, e.g. \NNext with finite verb *hofft*. The coherent construction in \Next[a] is thus monoclausal, while the non-coherent construction in \NNext[a] consists of two clauses.

\ex.
 \a.    Der Protest gibt ihr zu denken.
 \b.    Es ist bekannt, dass der Protest ihr zu denken gibt.
 \c. \* Es ist bekannt, dass der Protest gibt ihr zu denken.

\ex.
 \a.    Der Sportler hofft den Wettkampf zu gewinnen.
 \b. \* Es ist bekannt, dass der Sportler den Wettkampf zu gewinnen hofft.
 \c.    Es ist bekannt, dass der Sportler hofft den Wettkampf zu gewinnen.

In some intermediate cases both orders are possible, as shown in \Next. These constructions will be called 'semi-coherent' here.

\ex.
 \a.    Ich helfe dir den Koffer zu tragen.
 \b.    Es ist bekannt, dass ich dir helfe den Koffer zu tragen.
 \c.    Es ist bekannt, dass ich dir den Koffer zu tragen helfe.

Maybe surprisingly, when the above definition of monoclausality is strictly followed, then there appear to be dozens of verbs that can be used as the finite 'auxiliary' in a coherent multi-verb construction. When used as finite auxiliaries, these verbs are strongly grammaticalised, i.e. they shed much of their lexical meaning when used in multi-verb constructions. Such grammaticalised verbs are classified into different groups and referred to by many different names in the German grammatical literature, e.g. *Hilfsverb*, *Kopulaverb*, *Modalverb*, *Modalitätsverb*, *Halbmodalverb* [@eisenberg2006a], *Funktionsverb* [Polenz 1963 cited in @kamber2008: 34], *Strukturverb* [@weber2005], or *Stützverb* [Seelbach 1991 cited in @kamber2008: 34]. I will not pursue the question here how to classify these verbs into different kinds. I will simply refer to the whole group of these 'auxiliary' verbs as \textsc{light verbs}. All light verbs that will be discussed in later chapters are shown here in alphabetical order in \Next, though note that not all of them are involved in diathesis. A minority of the verbs listed below are only attested in monoclausal alternation without diathesis.

\ex. *anfangen, aufhören, aussehen, beginnen, bekommen, bleiben, brauchen, bringen, drohen, dürfen, erscheinen, fahren, finden, fühlen, geben, gehen, gehören, gelten, glauben, haben, halten, heißen, helfen, hören, kommen, kriegen, können, lassen, legen, lehren, liegen, machen, möchten, mögen, müssen, nehmen, pflegen, riechen, scheinen, schicken, sehen, sein, setzen, sollen, spüren, stehen, tun, versprechen, werden, wirken, wissen, wollen*

### Grammaticalisation of lexical meaning

A difficult problem is the question whether it is really the same verb that is used in two alternating constructions. For example, the verb *trinken* 'to drink' is a regular transtive verb, but when used intransitively, *er trinkt* 'he drinks', it has a clear implication that his drinking includes too much alcohol, so it might be better translated as 'he is an alcoholic'. In this case, this intransitive interpretation is probably best analysed as a conventional implicature, because the alcoholism aspect of the meaning can be suppressed given the right context.

In general, when the same lexical verb is used in different alternating constructions, then there is (of course) a difference in meaning between the two occurrences. However, ideally this difference is completely induced by the respective constructions and not by the lexical verb itself. Yet, it is extremely common for the combination of a lexical verb with the surrounding construction to grammaticalise into a new meaning. For example, the verb *auftreten* means something like 'to act' as an intransitive, but *to kick open* as a transitive. Both meanings originate from the meaning 'to step on something (by foot)'. Likewise, historical processes can lead to current homophony of two different lexemes. This appears to be the case for example with the verb *abhauen*, which is a transitive verb meaning 'cut of' (e.g. *Er hat den Ast abgehauen*). However, it has attained another usage during the course of the 20th century as an intransitive verb meaning 'run away' (e.g. *Er ist abgehauen*), probably based on a southern German dialectal meaning of *hauen* 'to go, to walk' [@pfeiffer1993: "hauen", accessed 12.12.2018].

In between those extremes (i.e. conventional implicature and different lexicalisation) there exist various intermediate phenomena. For example, the verb *hängen* 'to hang' can be used as a regular intransitive verb with a location, like *Er hängt an einem Seil* 'He dangles to a rope', but the specific combination with the preposition *an* can also have a special reading of 'being emotionally attached to something', like in *Er hängt an seinem Teddy* 'He is (emotionally) attached to his Teddy'. In this case it seems most appropriate to interpret the combination *hängen an* as a separate lexicalisation, though the path of the conventional implicature can still be intuitively grasped.

As with all grammaticalisation processes, it is often difficult to decide where to draw the line on the continuum between conventional implicature, metaphorical extension (*trinken*) and contextual lexicalisation (*hängen an*) or completely different lexicalisation (*auftreten*, *abhauen*). I tend to be rather lenient in allowing slightly different meanings to be included as the 'same' verb, but will exclude clear examples of the latter two types on the continuum as separate lexicalisations of homophonous elements.

### Lexeme-specific lexical roles

A crucial aspect of diathesis is that the lexical roles do not change, only the grammatical encoding of the roles changes. For example, the verb *füllen* 'to fill' occurs in various monoclausal constructions \Next, but the roles of (i) 'filler', (ii) 'filled container' and (iii) 'filling substance' are always the same. The different grammatical forms that are used to express these roles are added after each sentence in the examples below (NOM: Nominative, ACC: accusative, PREP: prepositional phrase, ZERO: unexpressed).

\ex.
 \a. Ich fülle den Topf (mit Reis). (i) NOM, (ii) ACC, (iii) PREP
 \b. Ich fülle den Reis in den Topf. (i) NOM, (ii) PREP, (iii) ACC
 \c. Der Reis füllt (mir) den Magen. (i) DAT, (ii) ACC, (iii) NOM
 \d. Der Blumentopf füllt sich (mit Wurzeln). (i) ZERO, (ii) NOM, (iii) PREP

Already from this example it becomes clear that it is often really difficult, if not impossible, to attach a specific valency to a verb. Given that most (and possibly all) German lexemes show some kind of diathesis, I reject the traditional notion of a fixed valency belonging to a specific verb (see [@sec:intro-valency] for a more extensive discussion). Alternatively, I propose that it is possibly to list all lexeme-specific roles as a fixed characteristic of each lexical verb. The following criteria can be used to determine the lexical roles of a verb:

First, each role that is case-marked in at least one clause-alternant is a lexeme-specific role. In the example of *füllen* im \Last, each of the three roles is marked as nominative, accusative or dative in at least one of the alternants, so all three roles are lexeme-specific. Various exceptions and stipulations to this criterion are discussed in [@sec:case-delimiting-arguments].

Second, all obligatory prepositional phrases are lexeme-specific roles. Such prepositional phrases, that cannot be left out, are not very widespread in German and mostly designate a location. Some verbs always expect such a location-role \Next[a,b], see e.g. [@sec:prepositions-obligatory-local; @sec:reflexive-obligatory-local], but more widespread are resultative diatheses that introduce an obligatory local role \Next[c,d], see e.g. [@sec:prepositions-action-result].

\ex.
 \a.    Der Stuhl befindet sich im Wohnzimmer
 \b. \* Der Stuhl befindet sich.
 \c.    Ich breche ein Loch in den Felsen.
 \d. \* Ich breche ein Loch.

Third, there is a large class of lexeme-specific prepositional phrases that I will call 'governed' prepositions, like *arbeiten an* 'to work on' \Next[]. These prepositional phrases are not obligatorily present \Next[b]. The intuition behind governed prepositions is that these prepositions are lexically determined by the verb and often strongly grammaticalised both semantically and structurally. Semantically, the preposition *an* in \Next[a] is strongly bleached with no aspect of its local meaning of 'touching' remaining. Syntactically, the prepositional phrase in *arbeiten an* can be filled with a complement clause of the form *daran, dass CLAUSE* \Next[c]. This syntactic criterion will be used as the main chracteristic to identify governed prepositions. Various exceptions and stipulations to this criterion are discussed in [@sec:prepositions-delimiting-governed-prepositional-phrases]. 

\ex.
 \a. Ich arbeite an dem Buch.
 \b. Ich arbeite hart.
 \c. Ich arbeite daran, dass das Buch fertig wird.

Lexical roles are called 'verb-specific semantic roles' in Van Valin [-@van-valin2004] and 'microroles' in Hartmann et al. [-@hartmann2014]. The obvious next step (as discussed in both these papers) is to cluster such microroles into clusters of semantic/thematic mesoroles, i.e. widespread roles like 'agent', 'patiens', 'experiencer' etc. Such semantic roles are used constantly in contemporary linguistics, but they are surprisingly ill-defined. For example, given a random German verb like *füllen* as exemplified at the start of this section: what should be its semantic roles, and what criteria should be used to determine this? Hartmann et al. [-@hartmann2014] and Cysouw [-@cysouw2014a] use cross-linguistic data to approach this question. However, such an approach does not allow for language-specific definitions.

My proposal for a language-specific determination of semantic roles is to use the applicability of diatheses as a criterion. For example, a patiens in German might be defined as those lexical roles that are changed from accusative to nominative in the *werden* passive diathesis. Or more general: a semantic role can be defined by a combination of applicable diatheses. The research project to determine suitable combinations of diatheses will not be pursued here, but left for a follow-up investigation.

### Domain of application

A widespread assumption in linguistic analysis is that most alternations (including diatheses) have a sensible domain of application. This is the idea that there is some rationale, often a kind of semantic characterisation, explaining which roots allow for a specific kind of linguistic marking (e.g. only transitive verbs allow for a *werden* passive). Although I also believe that many alternations, including diatheses, mostly behave sensibly, I would also warn not to expect too much regular (semantic) generalisations being hidden in grammatical structure. Many grammatical regularities have unexpected exceptions, be it because of haphazard diachronic changes or through only partial analogical extension. Even stronger, some grammatical marking appears to be almost completely without rationale, like the assignment of plural allomorphy in German.

As a practical approach to the domain of application of a specific alternation (say, which verbs allow for the *werden* passive or the *sich* anticausative), I propose to always first enumerate as much examples as possible. Not be content with four or five cases that suggest a neat semantic coherence, but also list as many as possible further examples, idiosyncratic as they may be. Only after such a formal listing of the domain of application is it possible to investigate the presence of any (semantic) rationale. In many cases there might be a (partial) rationale, but it is just as likely (and just as interestingly) to have to conclude that there apparently is none.

Taking this principle one step further, I propose to *define* the domain of application as the concrete listing of all examples. Any (semantic) characterisation is then always a post-hoc generalisation, not a definition. This is the approach that I will follow in this book. For each diathesis I will list as many as possible example verbs that take part in the diatheses (for some I will reverse the approach and list verbs that are not part of the domain of application). In some cases, I will speculate about semantic generalisations, but I consider these generalisations always to be secondary to the concrete listing of examples.

This principle of the definition by listing even holds for questions of productivity. For example, when I propose *flurchten* to be a new verb for the German language, then I partially define its meaning by stating what kind of diatheses it can take part in. Depending on how such a new verb is contextualised, the following construction might or might not be judged grammatical. The choices made influence the meaning of the verb.

\ex.
 \a. Ich flurchte den X.
 \b. Ich flurchte an den X.
 \c. Ich flurchte mich vor den X.
 \d. Der X flurchtet.
 \e. Der X flurchtet sich.

## Valency {#sec:intro-valency}

A diathesis thus consists of two monoclausal constructions with the same lexical verb, but with different encoding of the lexical roles.

For the analysis of a particular diathesis, and for the classification of the many different diatheses into kinds of diathesis, we need an analysis of the encoding.

- Utterance valency and lexeme valency: Valency should not be seen as a characteristic of lexemes, but as a characteristic of utterances.
- Arguments within utterance valency: Arguments should be defined within utterances, not as characteristics of a lexeme.

### Utterance valency and lexeme valency

Valency is traditionally interpreted as a fixed constructional characteristic of a lexical verb, e.g. the verb *geben* 'to give' is said to be ditransitive. A central thesis of this book is that this conception of valency is misguided. Individual verbs can (and normally will) be used in many different constructions with different valency (i.e. most verbs show some kind of diathesis). Consider for example the verb *wehen* 'to blow'. Such 'weather' verbs are often considered to have zero valency, which in German is characterised by an obligatory *es* pronoun \Next[a]. However, the same verb can just as well be used as an intransitive \Next[b,c], as a transitive with an accusative object \Next[d], or even as a ditransitive with a dative and accusative object \Next[e]. Note that the prepositional phrase in \Next[c,d,e] cannot be left out, and its obligatory presence might be used to argue for argument-status of these prepositional phrases. The example in \Next[e] then will be an example of the verb *wehen* with a valency of four.

\ex.
 \a. Heute weht es.
 \b. Gester wehte kein Lüftchen.
 \c. Der Rosenduft weht ins Zimmer.
 \d. Der Sturm weht den Schnee von den Dächern.
 \e. Der Fahrtwind weht mir die Mütze vom Kopf.

There is a recurrent tendency in the literature to try and reduce such variation to a single valency per verb (viz. its 'real' or 'underlying' valency), and various strategies are employed to arrive at such a prototypical valency [see e.g. @welke2011: Ch. 9 for a survey]. That will not be the approach taken here. Instead, valency is proposed to be a characteristic of a specific utterance, not of a specific verb. So, the examples in \Last can simple be assigned an \textsc{utterance valency} from zero \Last[a] to four \Last[e] even though they all use the same lexeme *wehen* as their main verb. 

Additionally, it is of course possible to define a notion of \textsc{lexeme valency} as the collection of all attested utterance valencies for a specific lexeme. To be precise, the lexeme valency is properly defined as the collection of all utterance valencies, together with an indexation of the lexical roles across all arguments. This addition is important to distinguish between, for example, the lexical valency of *kochen* 'to cook' \Next and *essen* 'to eat' \NNext. Both can occur with a transitive and intransitive utterance valency, but the lexical roles that can be used in the intransitive differ. Specifically, the patient-role of *essen* cannot be used as nominative subject in the intransitive \NNext[c], different from *kochen* \Next[c]. In effect, these verbs have a different lexical valency.

\ex.
 \a. Der Chef kocht den Fond.
 \b. Der Chef kocht immer noch.
 \c. Der Fond kocht immer noch.

\ex.
 \a.    Der Chef isst den Fond.
 \b.    Der Chef isst immer noch.
 \c. \* Der Fond isst immer noch.

### Arguments of utterance valency

First, all case marked noun phrase constituents are arguments, with a few exceptions that will be discussed in [@sec:case-delimiting-arguments]. Basically, case marked arguments \Next[a] can be questioned by question pronouns *wer* or *was*, including their case forms *wem*, *wen* and *wessen* \Next[b,c]. Further, they can be pronominalised by personal pronouns \Next[d] or indefine pronouns *(irgend)jemand* or *(irgend)etwas* \Next[e].

\ex.
 \a. Der Löwe sieht einen Vogel.
 \b. Wer sieht einen Vogel?
 \c. Was sieht der Löwe?
 \d. Er sieht ihn.
 \e. Jemand sieht etwas.

Second, prepositional phrases \Next[a] are arguments of an utterance when they can be replaced by a complement clause of the form *da(r)+preposition, dass ...* \Next[b]. All details of the difficult question when to treat prepositional phrases as arguments are discussed in [@sec:prepositions-delimiting-governed-prepositional-phrases].

\ex.
 \a. Der Weltreisende wartet auf einen Zug.
 \b. Der Weltreisende wartet darauf, dass ein Zug kommt.

=> obligatory prepositional phrases!

Third, all complement clauses are arguments \Next[a,b], see Chapter [-@sec:subordination]. Complement clauses can be questioned by *was* \Next[c] and pronominalised by a definite pronoun *es* \Next[d] or an indefinite pronoun *(irgend)etwas* \Next[e]. Complement clauses are thus syntactically highly similar to case marked noun phrases. Caution should be taken when interpreting pronominalised examples like \Next[d,e], because it is not immediately obvious whether the pronouns are replacing a case-marked noun phrase or a complement clause. For example, with the verb *hoffen* \Next[e] it is not possible to replace the pronoun *etwas* with a noun phrase.

\ex.
 \a. Er hofft, dass er rechtzeitig kommt.
 \b. Er hofft rechtzeitig zu kommen.
 \c. Was hofft er?
 \d. Er hofft es.
 \e. Er hofft etwas.

=> preparation: only monoclausal structures, no stacking of constructions!

=> step 1: assign forms in sentence valency. Only real difficulty is prepositional phrases (governed, non-governed, obligatory) and obligatory adverbials

=> step 2: classify forms in groups: SBJ and OBJ might be called 'arguments'.

Sentence Arguments!

Definition of "Subject" and "Object":

- Subject is a nominative constituent with person agreement with the finite verb.
- Objects are all case-marked governed constituents and governed prepositional phrases and obligatory constituents. 

Subject (SBJ):

N = Nominative case

Objects (OBJ):

A = Accusative case
D = Dative case
G = Genitive case
P = Lexically governed preposition
L = Obligatory location

Adjuncts/Minor role expressions (ADJ):

a = Accusative reflexive argument
d = Dative reflexive argument
g = Adnominal genitive
p = Non-governed preposition

Zero (Ø):

– = Unexpressed role

Of crucial importance for the description of diathesis is the proper identification of lexically governed constituents, i.e. the arguments of a clausal predicate ('verb'). Intuitively, the arguments of a predicate are those roles/participants that are inherently part of the meaning of the lexeme. For example, a verb like 'to accuse' implies the presence of an accuser, an accussee and an accusation. However, a purely introspective semantic determination of such lexical roles is fraught with unverifiable intuitive decisions. A widespread idea is that for a constituent to be an inherent argument, the constituent in question should be invoked specifically by the lexical predicate and not have an adjunct status available to every predicate throughout the language. Yet, this intuition of a difference between arguments and adjuncts has to be operationalised in more detail. As an operationalisation, I propose to determine the arguments of a predicate based on a series of form-based structural arguments, to be detailed below. Note that these arguments are specifically tailored to the German language structure and cannot integrally be translated to other languages.

### *es* Arguments

A further kind of utterance-valency argument is instantiated by *es*, the 3rd person nominative/accusative pronoun in the neutrum gender. There are various uses of this pronoun that have to be distinguished, because the first three do not have argument-status. First, *es* is used for anaphoric reference to neutrum nouns, as shown in \Next. There are various other variants of such \textsc{phoric} usage, for example it also occurs without direct gender agreement [@czicza2014: Ch. 2]. 

\ex. Das Mädchen weint. Ich tröste es.

Second, another kind of referential *es* occurs with some non-finite complement clauses. In most sentences a complement clause replaces an argument \Next[a], but in some cases a pronoun *es* remains in place of the original argument, side by side with the complement clause \Next[b]. This is known as a \textsc{correlative} *es* [@czicza2014: 79ff.].

\ex.
 \a. Ich vergesse [meine Aufgaben]. Ich vergesse [schnell zu laufen].
 \b. Ich hasse [meine Aufgaben]. Ich hasse es [schnell zu laufen].

Third, the pronoun *es* is also used to fill the first sentence position in front of the finite verb ('Vorfeld' in German grammatical terminology), because there is a strong regularity in German that this position can not be left empty (except in imperatives and yes/no questions). Word order is rather flexible in German, and it is often possible to have no lexical content in the Vorfeld. In such cases, the pronoun *es* can be used to fill the Vorfeld, as shown in \Next[b]. This is known as a \textsc{position-simulating} *es* [@czicza2014: 115].

\ex. Ein Mädchen weint. Es weint ein Mädchen.

Finally, there are also constructions that obligatorily include the pronoun *es* in the sentence as part of the valency of the utterance. The main reason for such an *es* is that there is a strong regularity in German that a nominative subject has to be present in each sentence (with very few exceptions, see below). Note that 'subject' is defined here for German as the noun phrase that shows agreement with the finite verb. When there is no subject available, then the pronoun *es* is used to fill this gap. In such constructions, as exemplified in \Next[a,b], the pronoun *es* can occur in the Vorfeld \Next[a], seemingly parallel to the position-simulating usage \Last[b] above. However, When another constituent is placed in the Vorfeld, this obligatory *es* cannot be removed, but has to occur elsewhere in the sentence, typically immediately after the finite verb \Next[b]. This is known as a \textsc{valency-simulating} *es* [@czicza2014: 115].

\ex.
 \a. Es stinkt hier sehr.
 \b. Hier stinkt es sehr.

In a very limited set of constructions, a valency-simulating *es* is left out, resulting in sentences without a nominative subject \Next. Most of these cases are historical idiosyncrasies, except for the impersonal passive \Next[d], see [@sec:participles-werden-impersonal-passive].

\ex.
 \a. Heute ist mir kalt.
 \b. Dem Arzt graut vor Blut.
 \c. Mir liegt viel an deiner Anwesenheit.
 \d. Jetzt wird geschlafen!

There are also a few rare cases in which there is a valency-simulating *es* in what appear to be an accusative case \Next.

\ex.
 \a. Ich habe es auf ihn abgesehen. (see [@sec:prepositions-nominative-es-preposition])
 \b. Wir haben es gut. (see [@sec:adverbials-accusative-es])

## Classifying diatheses

In the discussion of the various diatheses in German, I will classify them into different kinds of diatheses. This classification is not a definitional issue, but purely a practical organizational device. It might very well turn out that some of these classifications is not ideal, i.e. that some alternation is better considered as belonging to a different kind. However, such a reorganization would not change anything about the diatheses themselves.

The different kinds of diatheses distinguished here have a long history in the typological literature [cf. @wunderlich1993; @wunderlich2015; @dixon2000a; @dixon2014; @haspelmath2004c; @malchukov2015: 96ff.]


- **PASSIVE: Promotion of a non-nominative argument to subject.** The typical characteristic of a passive is a non-nominatively case-marked role to being 'more important', typically becoming the subject (i.e. nominative + verb agreement). The original subject can optionally be retained as an non-nominative case or a prepositional phrase. In general, the original subject is still understood to be some kind of agent in the passive alternant.
- **ANTICAUSATIVE: Removal of a causer from subject.** The typical characteristic of an anticausative is the removal of the nominative subject which causes the action/state of the clause. Filling the gap, any non-nominative argument is promoted to subject. Note that in effect, such an alternation is highly similar to a passive. The main difference (which is often difficult to decide) is that for a passive the original subject is still implied (and can be overtly expressed), while for an anticausative the original subject is completely removed (e.g. a phrase like "by itself" can typically be added).

- **INVERTED PASSIVE**
- **CAUSATIVE: Addition of a new causer as subject.** The typical characteristic of a causative is the addition of a new nominative subject which causes the action/state as described in the original clause. The original nominative is typically retained as a non-nominative argument.
- **EXPERIENCER/BENEFACTIVE: addition of new subject with different role.**

- **REVERSAL: subject and object switch.** [@malchukov2015: 99-100]


- **ANTIAPPLICATIVE (ANTIPASSIVE): Demotion of a non-nominative argument to prepositional phrase.** The typical characteristic of an antipassive is a non-nominatively case-marked role to being marked as 'less important', typically becoming a prepositional phrase. The complete removal of this role can be seen as an extreme form of an antipassive, though I mostly classify such a removal separately as a **drop** of an argument.
- **APPLICATIVE: Addition of a new non-nominative argument.** The typical characteristic of an applicative is the introduction of a new non-nominatively marked role. Typically, a new role is marked as an accusative and the original accusatively marked role is encoded differently. It is also possible that the new role is not replacing any existing marking, but simply added to the argument structure of a verb. However, I will classify such completely new roles mostly as an **addition** of an argument.

- **RESULTATIVE: Addtion of a new causee as a non-nominative argument.** The typical characteristic of a resultative is the addition of a new causee. Instead of simply expressing the content of a predicate as the action/state of the clause, a resultative diatheses expressed that something is caused by performing the predicate.
- **ANTIRESULTATIVE**
- **POSSESSOR RAISING: possessor of an argument becomes a separate argument.**

- **OBJECT REVERSAL**

- **DROP** "deobjective" [@haspelmath2004c: 1131]
- **ADDITION**


Note that the term "resultative" is used by [@nedjalkov1988a] with a different meaning (viz. a special kind of anticausative)

Note: "active" is not a diathesis!

First use of "antipassive": [@silverstein1972: 395], known as 'deaccusative' [@geniusiene1987: 94] and antiapplicative [@haspelmath2004c: 1132]

=> check [@haspelmath2004c]

drop is named "antipassive" in [@scheibl2006: 372-373] and antipassive is called 'antiapplicative' [@scheibl2006: 371]



----

- isolated diathesis: only one participant changes its form
- chained diathesis: two participant change form, with (at least) one marking being exchanged
- multi-chained diathesis: more than two
- disjunct diathesis: two (or more) participants change form, no overlap between marking

Generalisation: Subject-diatheses are almost all chained
Generalisation: disjunct diatheses are very unusual overall


- mulit-chained
