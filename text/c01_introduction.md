# Setting the scene

## The daunting diversity of diathesis

The quintessential example of German diathesis, found in virtually every grammatical descriptions of German, is the *werden + Partizip* passive construction [@Next a]. A central characteristic of this construction is that the state-of-affairs as described by this passive is fundamentally the same as in the corresponding active [@Next b], though the sentence structure of course differs between the two expressions.

:::ex
a.  Das Gemälde wird (von einem Künstler) gemalt.
b.  Der Künstler malt ein Gemälde.
:::

This approach to diathesis, viz. different grammatical sentence structures that express approximately the same state-of-affairs, is applicable to a large number of grammatical phenomena in German. For example, some verbs allow for passive-like constructions without any *werden* auxiliary, often called 'anticausative' [@Next a]. Other verbs allow for an alternation between a case-marked accusative and a prepositional phrase, often called 'antipassive' [@Next b]. Further, there exist many different kinds of diathesis marked by a reflexive pronoun *sich* [@Next c] or marked by preverbs like *ent-* [@Next d]. Many auxiliary-like construction beyond the *werden + Infinitiv* passive also show diathesis, e.g. *sein + zu + Infinitive* [@Next e].^[Many examples in this book contain masculine nouns, not because of laziness on my behalf, but because their definite articles overtly show the different German cases (*der, des, dem, den*). Notwithstanding this grammatical preference, I will try to use examples with as much diversity as possible throughout this book.]

:::ex
a.  Der Doktor heilt den Schmerz. Der Schmerz heilt (durch den Doktor).
b.  Der Jäger schießt den Bären. Der Jäger schießt auf den Bären.
c.  Der Lehrer beklagt den Lärm. Der Lehrer beklagt sich über den Lärm.
d.  Der Kandidat stammt aus einem Adelsgeschlecht. Der Kandidat entstammt einem Adelsgeschlecht
e.  Der Ermittler löst den Fall. Der Fall ist (für den Ermittler) leicht zu lösen.
:::

All in all, there are about 200 different German diatheses described in this book, some highly productive, some only attested for a handful of verbs. The main goal of this book is to present this wealth of grammatical possibility in a unified manner, while at the same time attempting to classify and organise this diversity. I will make no attempt to fit all these constructional possibilities of the German language into any specific grammatical framework, although the collection of diatheses presented here might be taken as a modelling-challenge for any grammatical theory.

<!--
^[Note that this challenge can be easily resolved by simply including a (long) list of primitive monoclausal constructions into the theory, because all diatheses produce monoclausal constructions by definition (see below).]
-->

It might come as a surprise that there are so many different diatheses in German, but my impression is that German is no exception among the world's languages in this respect. I expect that all languages have a wealth of different ways in which to construe a sentence around a lexical predicate. In a sense, diatheses allow for the expression of different perspectives on the event described, something that is arguably a common desire of any language user. Looking at it this way, diathesis belongs squarely in the same domain of grammatical analysis as tense, aspect, mood or evidentiality.

In this book, each diathesis has its own sub-subsection with an unique section header that can be used as a name to refer to the diathesis (e.g. [@sec:participles-werden-passive] on the *werden + Partizip* passive). Many of these unique names are quite boring, but hopefully descriptively useful for future reference. Individual verbs (often with concrete examples) are listed with each diathesis to show the extend of its applicability. Neither these lists of verbs nor the examples are intended to be exhaustive in any way. They should be seen as a first step towards more in-depth research into individual diatheses or into the different constructional possibilities that exist for individual verbs.

The current attempt to present a all-encompassing survey of German diathesis builds on a rich scholarly tradition (with many scholarly precursors to be cited in appropriate places throughout this work). A comparable and highly influential survey of diathesis for English is Levin [-@levin1993], followed by a similar attempt for German by Sauerland [-@sauerland1994]. A recent cross-linguistic survey of valency and diathesis in this tradition is edited by Malchukov & Comrie [-@malchukov2015a], which also includes data on German [@haspelmath2013a]. Independent of Levin's work, there is a long tradition in the German grammatical literature to investigate diathesis, e.g. as "Konversenverhältnis der Aktanten" [@eroms1980: 24; cf. @heringer1968]. Basic summaries of german diathesis in the context of valency can be found in Eroms [-@eroms2000: Ch. 10] or Ágel [-@agel2000: Ch. 6]. There even exist a few monographs about specific German diatheses [e.g. @leirbukt1997; @holl2010; @jager2013] and recently some corpus studies into the effect of specific diatheses on individual verbs have appeared [@devaere2018; @imo2018].

Diathesis is of course closely linked to the concept of valency, so the groundbreaking valency dictionary for German by Helbig and Schenkel [-@helbig1991] deserves mentioning. They identify the problem that certain verbs can be used in different constructions, but diatheses are not investigated in their dictionary. Another highly influential valency dictionary for German, edited by Schumacher [-@schumacher1986], consistently discusses passive diatheses for all verb. I see the current survey of German diatheses as a first step in extending such valency dictionaries into even more all-encompassing dictionaries that discuss all possible clause constructions for each verb.

## Defining diathesis {#sec:intro-basic-definition}

A diathesis is defined here as special kind of alternation between two different clause constructions. To properly define the notion 'diathesis', I will first define 'alternation' in general. Next, the definition of 'clause alternation' will be built on that basis. Finally, a diathesis will then be defined as special kind of clause alternation. A few crucial concepts that are used in the following definitions will be discussed in more detail in subsequent sections.

#### Alternation {.unnumbered}

An ~~alternation~~ (or simply 'grammatical marking') is defined as follows:

- An alternation consist of two different linguistic constructions, i.e. there are two **alternants**.
- The lexical root does not change in the alternation, i.e. there is some linguistic material in both alternants that remains the same.
- The difference between these alternants is overtly indicated by the presence of some grammatical linguistic elements.
- Typically, the overt marking introduces a **direction** into the alternation, i.e. one alternant consists of less/shorter/zero linguistic elements ('less marked') and one consists of more/longer/overt linguistic material ('more marked').
- In some cases, the direction of the alternation remains undecidable, i.e. the alternation is **equipollent**.

Alternations are the basis of all grammatical analysis. It includes for example (i) morphological oppositions like singular *Haus* 'house' vs. plural *Häuser* 'houses'; (ii) different grammatical forms like synthetic present *er schläft* 'he sleeps' vs. analytic perfect *er hat geschlafen* 'he has slept'; or (iii) different sentence constructions attested with specific verbs, like transitive *Ich verkaufe das Buch* 'I sell the book' vs. reflexive anticausative with obligatory adverbial *Das Buch verkauft sich gut* 'the book is selling well' (see [@sec:adverbial-reflexive-transitive-anticausative]).

#### Clause alternation {.unnumbered}

Based on the definition of an alternation, a ~~clause alternation~~ is defined as follows:

- In a clause alternation **both alternants are monoclausal**, i.e. both alternants contain a single main predicate. For German, the definitional property of monoclausality will be a phenomenon called 'coherence'.
- In both alternants, the **main predicate consists of the same lexeme**, i.e both contain the same verb.
- The **meaning of the lexical verb does not (substantially) change** between the alternants. 
- The **meaning/function of the whole clause changes** between the alternants. This functional difference is the whole point of having a clause alternation in the first place.
- The **lexical roles of the verb do not change** between the alternants. Lexical roles are an inherent part of the meaning of a verb and alternations do not change them. Note, however, that there might be new roles introduced or some roles might be left unexpressed.
- A specific clause alternation is only applicable to a restricted set of verbs. The list of applicable verbs constitutes the **domain of application** of the alternation. Any semantic/syntactic characterisation of these applicable verbs should be seen as a summary of the domain of application, not its definition.

Clause alternations are widespread when auxiliaries are introduced, like modal *müssen* 'have to' [@Next a], see [@sec:infinitive-mussen]. Moreover, clause alternation are attested with many different kind of marking, like the verb particle *auf* marking completeness of the action [@Next b], see [@sec:prepositions-accusative-antipassive], or the somewhat mysterious 'free' reflexive *sich* with verbs like *ansehen* 'look at' [@Next c], see [@sec:reflexive-free-dative-sich-accusative]. Arguably, the special word order in German subordinate clauses (viz. the finite verb occurs clause-final) can also be considered to be a clause alternation.

:::ex
a.  Er erledigt seine Hausaufgaben. Er muss seine Hausaufgaben erledigen.
b.  Ich esse den Apfel. Ich esse den Apfel auf.
c.  Er hat das Haus angesehen. Er hat sich das Haus angesehen.
d.  Er erledigt seine Hausaufgaben. Ich hoffe, dass er seine Hausaufgaben erledigt.
:::

#### Diathesis {.unnumbered}

Based on the notion of a clause alternation, a ~~diathesis~~ (sometimes also known as 'valency alternation') is defined as follows:

- A diathesis is a clause alternation in which at least one of the lexical roles is overtly marked differently between the clausal alternants, i.e. **at least one of the roles is remapped to a different grammatical expression** (i.e. there is a role-marking alternation).
- Remapped roles do not substantially change their meaning, i.e. **'who does what to whom' does not change**.
- The details of the relation between the main predicate and the remapped roles can (and normally will) change. There will be **changes in meaning**, e.g. aspects like the role's influence on the action or its affectedness by the predicate might change.
- As an extreme case, the reframing of a role might consist in the **addition** of a completely new role or in the **complete removal** of an existing role.
- As is true for all alternations, a diathesis has a **direction** from a formally 'less marked' to a 'more marked' alternant. However, in some special instances a diathesis can show no other overt marking than the change in marking of the reframed roles itself. This will be called a **covert diathesis** (or equipollent/bare diathesis).
- As a practical restriction, I will only consider diatheses in which one alternant is a clauses with a single finite verb ('active').

The prototypical example of a diathesis is the *werden + Partizip* passive [@Next a], see [@sec:participles-werden-passive]. In both clause alternants the same state of affairs is described, but the marking of the participants is different. However, the diversity of diatheses in German is enormous as this book attempts to show. There are, for example, bare diatheses (i.e. diatheses without any marking on the verb) like the infamous anticausative in [@Next b], see [@sec:case-haben-anticausative], or antipassives marked with a reflexive pronoun as shown in [@Next c], see [@sec:reflexive-accusative-antipassive].

:::ex
a.  Der Schreiner hat den Tisch angemalt. Der Tisch wurde von den Schreiner angemalt.
b.  Ich koche den Kaffee. Der Kaffee kocht.
c.  Der Fahrradfahrer fürchtet den Anstieg. Der Fahrradfahrer fürchtet sich vor den Anstieg.
:::

Hidden in this succinct definition of diathesis there are various intricate grammatical concepts that need some more discussion in subsequent subsections.

## Definitional details

### Terminology

In the cross-linguistic survey of diathesis by Zuñiga & Kittilä [-@zuniga2019], they distinguish between the terms 'diathesis', 'diathetical operation', 'grammatical voice' and 'transitivity'. I completely subscribe to these conceptual distinctions. However, I have decided to simplify my terminology and basically use the term 'diathesis' for all four concepts.

A diathesis (as defined here) is an alternation between two clausal construction. To be more precise, this is what is called a 'diathetical operation' in Zuñiga & Kittilä [-@zuniga2019: 4], see also [@sec:intro-diathetical-operations] below. Each of the alternants show a different mapping of (grammatical) expressions onto (semantic) roles. Individually, each such mapping between expressions and roles is called a 'diathesis' in Zuñiga & Kittilä [-@zuniga2019: 4]. However, because I will only consider diathetical operations between an 'unmarked' and a 'marked' alternant, I have decided to simplify the terminology in this book. Both the alternation itself (Zuñiga & Kittilä's diathetical operation, e.g. 'causativisation') and the marked alternant (Zuñiga & Kittilä's diathesis, e.g. 'causative') will be referred to here as diathesis. A side-effect of this approach is that 'active' is not in itself a diathesis, but simply the unmarked counterpart of a diathetical operation.

The actual linguistic marking of the diathesis (for example by verbal morphology or auxiliaries) is called 'grammatical voice' in Zuñiga & Kittilä [-@zuniga2019: 4], see also [@sec:intro-voice] below. In this book, each diathesis is defined as a combination of a (re-)mapping of roles and a specific kind of linguistic marking of the main predicate. So again, this extra terminological distinction is not necessary in this book. The formal expression ('grammatical voice') is simply a definitional part of each diathesis here.

The term 'transitivity' [@zuniga2019: 3; following @hopper1980] describes a (recurrent) connection between a diathetical operation and semantic effects on the meaning of the clause. For example, when an accusative argument is remapped onto a prepositional phrase, this often implies less involvement of the argument. The details of such semantic effects of each of the diatheses in this book is a fascinating topic, for which I unfortunately can only offer limited insights throughout. In practice, I assume that each diathesis as described here has some kind of semantic effect, but the details of these effect need much more detailed research that has to be provided by subsequent work.

Finally, I prefer to use the term 'diathesis' over the frequently attested term 'valency alternation', because there are many diatheses (i.e. constructions with obviously reframed roles) in which the valency does not change between the alternants, e.g. [@Next] in which both sentences have a nominative, accusative and prepositional phrase. There is a clear diathesis in this example, though arguably there is no change in (basic) valency. Strictly speaking, valency alternations are a subset of all diatheses.

a.  Ich schmiere Salbe auf die Wunde.
b.  Ich beschmiere die Wunde mit Salbe.
:::

### Monoclausality and coherence

Diatheses are defined above as alternations between single clauses with the same main verb. However, a single clause in German can sometimes consist of multiple verb forms. It is crucial to strictly distinguish between situations in which a multi-verb construction is monoclausal and when it is not. The basis of the definition of monoclausality in German is a concept called ~~coherence~~.

All diatheses listed in this book are monoclausal. Besides trying to list all German diatheses, I will also list all non-diathesis clause alternation, i.e monoclausal alternations without any change in sentence structure (these are always listed in the .4 section of each chapter). This book can thus also be read as a listing of all German monoclausal constructions, with or without valency change. Somewhat unexpectedly, the number of alternations without any change in valency (i.e. the alternations without diathesis) is much smaller than the number of monoclausal alternations with changes in role marking (i.e. the diatheses).

To define monoclausality, the crucial characteristic of German syntax is that the finite verb is moved to the end of the sentence in a subordinate clauses. I will use the dummy main sentence *Es ist bekannt, dass…* 'it is known that' to force a subordinate construction. The position of the finite verb in the subordinate clause can be used the identify the boundary of the clause: everything that can occur before the finite verb belongs to the clause; everything that has to come after the finite verb belongs to a different clause. For example, the simple sentence [@Next a] will turn into [@Next b] as a subordinate clause, with the finite verb at the end; [@Next c] is not possible (with any constituent after the finite verb), so the whole sentence in [@Next a] is a single clause. Constructions with such a pattern will be called ~~coherent~~, following Bech [-@bech1955]; see also Kiss [-@kiss1995] for a more in-depth and more extensive discussion of the concept 'coherence'. Coherent constructions are considered to be ~~monoclausal~~.

:::ex
a.   Ich gehe morgen nach Hause.
b.   Es ist bekannt, dass ich morgen nach Hause gehe.
c.  ^* Es ist bekannt, dass ich gehe morgen nach Hause.
:::

Exactly the same coherence is attested in auxiliary constructions with participles [@Next] and infinitives [@NNext]. Such constructions are also monoclausal.

:::ex
a.   Ich habe gestern ein Haus gekauft.
b.   Es ist bekannt, dass ich gestern ein Haus gekauft habe.
c.  ^* Es ist bekannt, dass ich gestern gekauft habe ein Haus.
:::

:::ex
a.   Ich will morgen ein Haus kaufen.
b.   Es ist bekannt, dass ich morgen ein Haus kaufen will.
c.  ^* Es ist bekannt, dass ich morgen kaufen will ein Haus.
:::

Constructions with *zu* and infinitive are sometimes coherent, e.g. [@Next] with finite verb *gibt*, and sometimes non-coherent, e.g. [@NNext] with finite verb *hofft*. The coherent construction in [@Next a] is thus monoclausal, while the non-coherent construction in [@NNext a] consists of two clauses.

:::ex
a.   Der Protest gibt ihr zu denken.
b.   Es ist bekannt, dass der Protest ihr zu denken gibt.
c.  ^* Es ist bekannt, dass der Protest gibt ihr zu denken.
:::

:::ex
a.   Der Sportler hofft den Wettkampf zu gewinnen.
b.  ^* Es ist bekannt, dass der Sportler den Wettkampf zu gewinnen hofft.
c.   Es ist bekannt, dass der Sportler hofft den Wettkampf zu gewinnen.
:::

In some intermediate cases both orders are possible, as shown in [@Next]. These constructions will be called 'semi-coherent' here.

:::ex
a.   Ich helfe dir den Koffer zu tragen.
b.   Es ist bekannt, dass ich dir helfe den Koffer zu tragen.
c.   Es ist bekannt, dass ich dir den Koffer zu tragen helfe.
:::

Maybe surprisingly, when the above definition of monoclausality is strictly followed, then there appear to be dozens of verbs that can be used as the finite 'auxiliary' in a coherent multi-verb construction. When used as finite auxiliaries, these verbs are strongly grammaticalised, i.e. they shed much of their lexical meaning when used in multi-verb constructions. Such grammaticalised verbs are classified into different groups and referred to by many different names in the German grammatical literature, e.g. *Hilfsverb*, *Kopulaverb*, *Modalverb*, *Modalitätsverb*, *Halbmodalverb* [@eisenberg2006a], *Funktionsverb* [Polenz 1963 cited in @kamber2008: 34], *Strukturverb* [@weber2005], or *Stützverb* [Seelbach 1991 cited in @kamber2008: 34]. I will not pursue the question here how to classify these verbs into different kinds. I will simply refer to the whole group of these 'auxiliary' verbs as ~~light verbs~~. All light verbs that will be discussed in later chapters are shown here in alphabetical order in [@Next], though note that not all of them are involved in diathesis. A few of the verbs listed below are only attested in monoclausal alternation without diathesis.

:::ex

:::

### Grammaticalisation of lexical meaning

A difficult problem is the question whether it is really the same verb that is used in two alternating constructions of a diathesis. For example, the verb *trinken* 'to drink' is a regular transitive verb, but when used intransitively, *er trinkt* 'he drinks', it has a clear implication that his drinking includes too much alcohol, so it might be better translated as 'he is an alcoholic'. In this case, this intransitive interpretation is probably best analysed as a conventional implicature, because the alcoholism aspect of the meaning can be suppressed given the right context.

In general, when the same lexical verb is used in different alternating constructions, then there is (of course) a difference in meaning between the two occurrences. However, ideally this difference is completely induced by the respective constructions and not by the lexical verb itself. Yet, it is extremely common for the combination of a lexical verb with the surrounding construction to grammaticalise into a new meaning. For example, the verb *auftreten* means something like 'to act' as an intransitive, but *to kick open* as a transitive. Both meanings originate from the meaning 'to step on something (by foot)'. Likewise, historical processes can lead to current homophony of two different lexemes. This appears to be the case for example with the verb *abhauen*, which is a transitive verb meaning 'cut of' (e.g. *Er hat den Ast abgehauen*). However, it has attained another usage during the course of the 20th century as an intransitive verb meaning 'run away' (e.g. *Er ist abgehauen*), probably based on a southern German dialectal meaning of *hauen* 'to go, to walk' [@pfeiffer1993: "hauen", accessed 12.12.2018].

In between those extremes (i.e. conventional implicature and different lexicalisation) there exist various intermediate phenomena. For example, the verb *hängen* 'to hang' can be used as a regular intransitive verb with a location, like *Er hängt an einem Seil* 'He dangles to a rope', but the specific combination with the preposition *an* can also have a special reading of 'being emotionally attached to something', like in *Er hängt an seinem Teddy* 'He is (emotionally) attached to his Teddy'. In this case it seems most appropriate to interpret the combination *hängen an* as a separate lexicalisation, though the path of the conventional implicature can still be intuitively grasped.

As with all grammaticalisation processes, it is often difficult to decide where to draw the line on the continuum between conventional implicature, metaphorical extension (*trinken*) and contextual lexicalisation (*hängen an*) or completely different lexicalisation (*auftreten*, *abhauen*). I tend to be rather lenient in allowing slightly different meanings to be included as the 'same' verb, but will exclude clear examples of the latter two types on the continuum as separate lexicalisations of homophonous elements.

### Lexeme-specific lexical roles {#sec:intro-lexical-roles}

A crucial aspect of diathesis is that the lexical roles do not change, only the grammatical encoding of the roles changes. For example, the verb *füllen* 'to fill' occurs in various monoclausal constructions [@Next], but the roles of (i) 'filler', (ii) 'filled container' and (iii) 'filling substance' are always the same. The different grammatical forms that are used to express these roles are added as subscripts to each sentence in the examples below.

:::ex
a.  Ich~i:\ NOM~ fülle den Topf~ii:\ ACC~ (mit Reis~iii:\ PREP~).
b.  Ich~i:\ NOM~ fülle den Reis~iii:\ ACC~ in den Topf~ii:\ PREP~.
c.  Der Reis~iii:\ NOM~ füllt (mir~i:\ DAT~) den Magen~ii:\ ACC~.
d.  Der Blumentopf~ii:\ NOM~ füllt sich (mit Wurzeln~iii:\ PREP~).
:::

Already from this example it becomes clear that it is often really difficult, if not impossible, to attach a specific valency to a verb. Given that most (and possibly all) German lexemes show some kind of diathesis, I reject the traditional notion of a fixed valency belonging to a specific verb (see [@sec:intro-valency] for a more extensive discussion). Alternatively, I propose that it is possibly to list all ~~lexeme-specific roles~~ (or equivalently ~~lexical roles~~) as a fixed characteristic of each lexical verb. The following criteria will be used to determine the lexical roles of a verb:

First, each role that is case-marked in at least one clause-alternant is a lexeme-specific role. In the example of *füllen* in [@Last], each of the three roles is marked as nominative, accusative or dative in at least one of the alternants, so all three roles are lexeme-specific. Various exceptions and stipulations to this criterion are discussed in [@sec:case-delimiting-arguments].

Second, all obligatory prepositional phrases are lexeme-specific roles. Such prepositional phrases, that cannot be left out, are not very widespread in German and mostly designate a location. Some verbs always expect such a location-role [@Next a,b], see e.g. [@sec:prepositions-obligatory-local; @sec:reflexive-obligatory-local], but more widespread are resultative diatheses that introduce an obligatory local role [@Next c,d], see e.g. [@sec:prepositions-action-result].

:::ex
a.   Der Stuhl befindet sich im Wohnzimmer
b.  ^* Der Stuhl befindet sich.
c.   Ich breche ein Loch in den Felsen.
d.  ^* Ich breche ein Loch.
:::

Third, there is a large class of lexeme-specific prepositional phrases that I will call ~~governed prepositions~~, like *arbeiten an* 'to work on' [@Next a]. These prepositional phrases are not obligatorily present [@Next b]. The intuition behind governed prepositions is that these prepositions are lexically determined by the verb and often strongly grammaticalised both semantically and structurally. Semantically, the preposition *an* with the verb *arbeiten* 'to work' [@Next a] is strongly bleached with none of its local 'touching' meaning remaining. Syntactically, the prepositional phrase in *arbeiten an* can be filled with a complement clause of the form *daran, dass …* [@Next c]. This syntactic criterion will be used as the main characteristic to identify governed prepositions. Various exceptions and stipulations to this criterion are discussed in [@sec:prepositions-delimiting-governed-prepositional-phrases]. 

:::ex
a.  Ich arbeite an meinem Buch.
b.  Ich arbeite hart.
c.  Ich arbeite daran, dass das Buch fertig wird.
:::

Under this approach, there are a few lexical roles that appear to be very widespread, up to the point of seemingly being universally applicable to all verbs. If that would be the case, then it would defeat the idea of lexeme-specific roles. However, on closer inspection my impression is that there are no roles that apply to all verbs. The closest contender is, arguably, the role of causer, which can be introduced to almost any German verb by using the *lassen + Infinitiv* diathesis [@Next], see [@sec:infinitive-lassen-causative]. However, there is a small group of verbs that do not allow for this diathesis, like *gefallen* 'to like' [@NNext]. This shows that even virtually universal roles are still lexically determined.

:::ex
a.  Der Student arbeitet an einer Aufgabe.
b.  Der Professor lässt den Student an einer Aufgabe arbeiten.
:::

:::ex
a.  Dein Haarschnitt gefällt mir.
b.  ^* Er lässt mir seinen Haarschnitt gefallen.
:::

Such lexeme-specific roles are called 'verb-specific semantic roles' in Van Valin [-@van-valin2004] and 'microroles' in Hartmann et al. [-@hartmann2014]. The obvious next step (as discussed in both these papers) is to cluster such microroles into clusters of semantic/thematic mesoroles, i.e. widespread roles like 'agent', 'patiens', 'experiencer' etc. Such semantic roles are used constantly in contemporary linguistics, but they are surprisingly ill-defined. For example, given a random German verb like *füllen* as exemplified at the start of this section: what should be its semantic roles, and what criteria should be used to determine this? Hartmann et al. [-@hartmann2014] and Cysouw [-@cysouw2014a] use cross-linguistic data to approach this question. However, such an approach does not allow for language-specific definitions, which is the problem in the current example of German.

My proposal for a language-specific determination of semantic mesoroles is to use the applicability of diatheses as a criterion. For example, a 'German Patiens' might be defined as those lexical roles that are changed from accusative to nominative in the *werden* passive diathesis. Or more general: a semantic role can be defined by a combination of applicable diatheses. The research project to determine suitable combinations of diatheses will not be pursued here, but left for a follow-up investigation.

### Domain of application

A widespread assumption in linguistic analysis is that most alternations (including diatheses) have a sensible domain of application. This is the idea that there is some rationale, often a kind of semantic characterisation, explaining which roots allow for a specific kind of linguistic marking (e.g. only transitive verbs allow for a *werden* passive). Although I also believe that many alternations, including diatheses, mostly behave sensibly, I would also warn not to expect too much regular (semantic) generalisations hidden in grammatical structure. Many grammatical regularities have unexpected exceptions, be it because of haphazard diachronic changes or through partial analogical extension. Even stronger, some grammatical marking appears to be almost completely without (semantic) rationale, like the assignment of plural allomorphy in German.

As a practical approach to the domain of application of a specific alternation (say, which verbs allow for the *werden* passive or the reflexive anticausative), I propose to always first enumerate as much examples as possible. In this book, I will not be satisfied with four or five cases that suggest a neat semantic coherence for a specific diathesis, but list as many as possible further examples, idiosyncratic as they may be. Only after such a formal listing of the domain of application (which ideally needs much more corpus research as I have been able to perform here) is it possible to investigate the presence of any (semantic) rationale. In many cases there might be a partial rationale, but it is just as likely (and just as interestingly) to have to conclude that there apparently is none.

Taking this principle one step further, I propose to *define* the domain of application as the concrete listing of all examples. Any (semantic) characterisation is then always a post-hoc generalisation, not a definition. This radically lexicalist interpretation is the approach that I will follow in this book. For each diathesis I will list as many as possible example verbs that take part in the diatheses (for some I will reverse the approach and list verbs that are not part of the domain of application). These lexical lists, ideally updated and completed in the future, are the definition of the domain of application. For some diatheses, I will speculate about semantic generalisations, but I consider these generalisations always to be secondary to the concrete listing of examples.

This principle of the definition by listing even holds for questions of productivity. For example, when somebody would propose a nonce-verb like *flurchten* to be a new verb for the German language in an experimental setting, then its meaning is partially defined by stating what kind of diatheses it can take part in. Depending on how such a new verb is contextualised, the following construction might or might not be judged grammatical. The choices that will be made influence the meaning of the verb.

:::ex
a.  Ich flurchte den X.
b.  Ich flurchte an den X.
c.  Ich flurchte mich vor den X.
d.  Der X flurchtet.
e.  Der X flurchtet sich.
:::

### Functional analysis

Intimately connected to the domain of application (i.e. which verbs allow for which diathesis) is the question as to the meaning/function of a specific diathesis. In essence, this question asks for a description of the difference between the meaning of the two alternants of a diathesis. For example, what is the difference between the transitive [@Next a] and the corresponding reflexive anticausative [@Next b], see [#sec:reflexive-anticausative].

:::ex
a.  Ich schließe die Tür.
b.  Die Tür schließt sich. 
:::

In general, it turns out to be extremely difficult to give a concise description of such differences, and I will mostly refrain from trying to provide such descriptions. Each diathesis is actually its own research project, preferably investigated using predictive corpus analysis [cf. the large literature on the English dative alternation, for German see e.g. @devaere2018]. The actual lists of verbs that allow for a specific diatheses (i.e. the domain of application, see above) also seems to be an important datapoint to investigate the function of a diathesis.

The problem of a functional description for a diathesis becomes even more difficult with the realisation that there are dozens of diatheses, often highly similar to each other. For example, it is really difficult [cf. @schafer2007; @kurogo2016] to characterise the difference between the reflexive anticausative above in [@Last] and the unmarked anticausative in [@Next], see [@sec:case-haben-anticausative]? 

:::ex
a.  Ich koche den Kaffee.
b.  Der Kaffee kocht.
:::

An important side-note in this respect are those alternations that have similar formal characteristics as diatheses, but which do not have any role-remapping. Such sentence alternations are not considered to be diatheses here, but they are still discussed in the .4 sections of each chapter. An example is the phenomenon of 'free' reflexives [@Next], see [#sec:reflexive-free-dative-sich-accusative]. Although there is no role-remapping in this alternation (and thus no diathesis), it turns out to be really difficult to describe the difference between [@Next a] and [@Next b]. All sentence alternations, with or without role-remapping, are in need of a functional analysis, and most such analyses will involve substantial research.

## Valency {#sec:intro-valency}

### Utterance valency and lexeme valency

Valency is traditionally interpreted as a fixed constructional characteristic of a lexical verb, e.g. the verb *geben* 'to give' is said to be ditransitive. A central thesis of this book is that this conception of valency is misguided. Individual verbs can (and normally will) be used in many different constructions with different valency (i.e. most verbs show some kind of diathesis). Consider for example the verb *wehen* 'to blow'. Such 'weather' verbs are often considered to have zero valency, which in German is characterised by an obligatory *es* pronoun [@Next a]. However, the same verb can just as well be used as an intransitive [@Next b,c], as a transitive with an accusative object [@Next d], or even as a ditransitive with a dative and accusative object [@Next e]. Note that the prepositional phrase in [@Next c,d,e] cannot be left out, and its obligatory presence might be used to argue for argument-status of these prepositional phrases. The example in [@Next e] then will be an example of the verb *wehen* with a valency of four.

:::ex
a.  Heute weht es.
b.  Gestern wehte kein Lüftchen.
c.  Der Rosenduft weht ins Zimmer.
d.  Der Sturm weht den Schnee von den Dächern.
e.  Der Fahrtwind weht mir die Mütze vom Kopf.
:::

There is a recurrent tendency in the literature to try and reduce such variation to a single valency per verb (viz. its 'real' or 'underlying' valency), and various strategies are employed to arrive at such a prototypical valency [see e.g. @welke2011: Ch. 9 for a survey]. That will not be the approach taken here. Instead, valency is proposed to be a characteristic of a specific utterance, not of a specific verb. So, the examples in [@Last] can simple be assigned an ~~utterance valency~~ from zero [@Last a] to four [@Last e] even though they all use the same lexeme *wehen* as their main verb. 

As a replacement of the traditional lexeme-specific notion of valency (i.e. *geben* is ditransitive), I propose to use the notion of lexeme-specific lexical roles. Lexical roles are participants that are treated as an argument in at least one of the possible diatheses of a verb (see [@sec:intro-lexical-roles] for the proper definition).

Additionally, it is of course possible to define a notion of ~~lexeme valency~~, for example as the collection of all attested utterance valencies for a specific lexeme. To be precise, the lexeme valency is properly defined as the collection of all utterance valencies, together with an indexation of the lexical roles across all arguments. This addition is important to distinguish between, for example, the lexical valency of *kochen* 'to cook' [@Next] and *essen* 'to eat' [@NNext]. Both can occur with a transitive and intransitive utterance valency, but the lexical roles that can be used in the intransitive differ. Specifically, the patient-role of *essen* cannot be used as nominative subject in the intransitive [@NNext c], different from *kochen* [@Next c]. In effect, these verbs have a different lexical valency.

:::ex
a.  Der Chef kocht den Fond.
b.  Der Chef kocht immer noch.
c.  Der Fond kocht immer noch.
:::

:::ex
a.   Der Chef isst den Fond.
b.   Der Chef isst immer noch.
c.  ^* Der Fond isst immer noch.
:::

### Arguments of utterance valency {#sec:intro-arguments-utterance-valency}

There are different kinds of utterance-valency arguments. First, all case marked noun phrase constituents are arguments, with a few exceptions that will be discussed in [@sec:case-delimiting-arguments]. Basically, case marked arguments [@Next a] can be questioned by question pronouns *wer* or *was*, including their case forms *wem*, *wen* and *wessen* [@Next b,c]. Further, they can be pronominalised by personal pronouns [@Next d] or indefinite pronouns *(irgend)jemand* or *(irgend)etwas* [@Next e].

:::ex
a.  Der Löwe sieht einen Vogel.
b.  Wer sieht einen Vogel?
c.  Was sieht der Löwe?
d.  Er sieht ihn.
e.  Jemand sieht etwas.
:::

Second, prepositional phrases [@Next a] are arguments of an utterance when they can be replaced by a complement clause of the form *da(r)+preposition, dass ...* [@Next b]. All details of the difficult question when to treat such governed prepositional phrases as arguments are discussed in [@sec:prepositions-delimiting-governed-prepositional-phrases].

:::ex
a.  Der Weltreisende wartet auf einen Zug.
b.  Der Weltreisende wartet darauf, dass ein Zug kommt.
:::

Third, there exist obligatory prepositional phrases, though they are not very widespread in German and mostly designate a location. Some verbs always expect such a location-role, like *sich befinden* 'to be located somewhere' [@Next a,b], see e.g. [@sec:prepositions-obligatory-local; @sec:reflexive-obligatory-local], but more widespread are resultative diatheses that introduce an obligatory local role, like with *brechen* 'to break' [@Next c,d], see e.g. [@sec:prepositions-action-result]. The example in [@Next c] crucially shows that arguments should be determined as part of the clause structure, not the lexeme structure. It is perfectly possible to use the verb *brechen* without a prepositional phrase [@Next e], but then there needs to be a different lexical role in the accusative.

:::ex
a.   Der Stuhl befindet sich im Wohnzimmer
b.  ^* Der Stuhl befindet sich.
c.   Ich breche ein Loch in den Felsen.
d.  ^* Ich breche ein Loch.
e.   Ich breche den Felsen.
:::

Finally, all complement clauses are arguments [@Next a,b], see Chapter [-@sec:subordination]. Complement clauses can be questioned by *was* [@Next c] and pronominalised by a definite pronoun *es* [@Next d] or an indefinite pronoun *(irgend)etwas* [@Next e]. Complement clauses are thus syntactically highly similar to case marked noun phrases. Caution should be taken when interpreting pronominalised examples like [@Next d,e], because it is not immediately obvious whether the pronouns are replacing a case-marked noun phrase or a complement clause. For example, with the verb *hoffen* [@Next e] it is not possible to replace the pronoun *es* with a noun phrase, though a governed prepositional phrase with *auf* is possible [@Next f].

:::ex
a.  Er hofft, dass er rechtzeitig kommt.
b.  Er hofft rechtzeitig zu kommen.
c.  Was hofft er?
d.  Er hofft es.
e.  ^* Er hofft eine gute Note.
f.  Er hofft auf eine gute Note.
:::

### *es* Arguments {#sec:intro-es}

A further kind of utterance-valency argument can be instantiated by *es*, the 3rd person nominative/accusative pronoun in the neuter gender. There are various uses of this pronoun that have to be distinguished. In the first three uses the pronouns *es* des not have argument-status (viz. phoric, correlative and position-simulating *es*). Only the fourth usage of *es* will be counted as an argument (viz. valency-simulating *es*). 

First, *es* can be used for anaphoric reference to neuter nouns, as shown in [@Next]. There are various other variants of such ~~phoric~~ usage, for example it also occurs without direct gender agreement [@czicza2014: Ch. 2]. 

:::ex
Das Mädchen weint. Ich tröste es.
:::

Second, another kind of referential *es* occurs with some non-finite complement clauses. By definition, a complement clause replaces an argument [@Next a], but in some cases a pronoun *es* remains in place of the original argument, side by side with the complement clause [@Next b]. This is known as a ~~correlative~~ *es* [@czicza2014: 79ff.].

:::ex
a.  Ich vergesse [meine Aufgaben]. Ich vergesse [schnell zu laufen].
b.  Ich hasse [meine Aufgaben]. Ich hasse es [schnell zu laufen].
:::

Third, the pronoun *es* is also used to fill the first sentence position in front of the finite verb ('Vorfeld' in German grammatical terminology), because there is a strong regularity in German that this position can not be left empty (except in imperatives and in yes/no questions). Word order is rather flexible in German, and it is often possible to have no lexical content in the Vorfeld. In such sentences, the pronoun *es* has to be used to fill the Vorfeld, as shown in [@Next b]. This is known as a ~~position-simulating~~ *es* [@czicza2014: 115].

:::ex
a.  Es weint ein Mädchen.
b.  Ein Mädchen weint. 
:::

Finally, there are also constructions that obligatorily include the pronoun *es* in the sentence as part of the valency of the utterance. The main reason for such an *es* is that there is a strong regularity in German that a nominative subject has to be present in each sentence (with very few exceptions, see below). Note that 'subject' is defined here for German as the nominative noun phrase that shows agreement with the finite verb. When there is no subject available, then the pronoun *es* is used to fill this gap. This is known as a ~~valency-simulating~~ *es* [@czicza2014: 115]. In the analysis of diatheses in this book, such valency-simulating *es* is not explicitly noted. Any clause without an "N"-marked argument induces a valency-simulating *es* (with very few exceptions, as noted below).

In constructions with a valency-simulating *es*, as exemplified in [@Next a,b], the pronoun *es* can occur in the Vorfeld [@Next a], seemingly parallel to the position-simulating usage [@Last a]. However, When another constituent is placed in the Vorfeld, this obligatory *es* in [@Next a] cannot be removed, but has to occur elsewhere in the sentence, typically immediately after the finite verb [@Next b]. 

:::ex
a.  Es stinkt hier sehr.
b.  Hier stinkt es sehr.
:::

In a very limited set of constructions, a valency-simulating *es* is left out, resulting in sentences without any formal nominative subject [@Next]. Most of these cases are historical idiosyncrasies, except for the impersonal passive [@Next d], see [@sec:participles-werden-impersonal-passive].

:::ex
a.  Heute ist mir kalt.
b.  Dem Arzt graut vor Blut.
c.  Mir liegt viel an deiner Anwesenheit.
d.  Jetzt wird geschlafen!
:::

There are also a few rare cases in which there is a valency-simulating *es* in what appears to be an accusative case [@Next].

:::ex
a.  Ich habe es auf ihn abgesehen. (see [@sec:prepositions-nominative-es-preposition])
b.  Wir haben es gut. (see [@sec:adverbials-accusative-es])
:::

### Adjuncts

Adjuncts, the counterparts of arguments, are phrases that are not specifically induced by the main verb of a clause. Typically, such adjuncts are adverbial prepositional phrases, see [@sec:prepositions-definition-non-governed]. Just like with arguments, adjunct status should not be linked to a lexical verb itself, but to the clause construction in which it is used. For example, the verb *tanzen* 'to dance' is typically considered to be an intransitive verb with optional (adjunct) locational prepositional phrases [@Next a,b]. However, there is a crucial difference between these two locations, see [@sec:prepositions-manner-of-movement]. The static location *im Saal* 'in the hall' [@Next a] remains optional in the perfect (with auxiliary *haben*), see [@Next c,d], while the dynamic location *in den Saal* 'into the hall' becomes obligatory in the perfect (with auxiliary *sein*), see [@Next e,f]. So, the obligatory location in [@Next e] is an utterance argument (and as a consequence, the role of 'path' is a lexical role of such verbs of movement like *tanzen*).

:::ex
a.  Ich tanze (im Saal).
b.  Ich tanze (durch den Saal).
c.  Ich habe im Saal getanzt.
d.  Ich habe getanzt.
e.  Ich bin durch den Saal getanzt.
f.  ^* Ich bin getanzt.
:::

Adjuncts are, by definition, optionally present, so there is a natural connection to zero expression. A central problem here is whether there is a crucial distinction between constructions in which a participant is obligatorily absent (i.e. impossible to express) vs. optionally absent (i.e. possibly not expressed). In most diatheses that involve absence, the whole point is that there is an alternation between absence and presence of a lexical role (e.g. in all drop and addition diatheses). The problematic cases are differences like passive vs. anticausative, which by definition are distinguished by possibility vs. impossibility for the agent to be expressed. This difference is highly volatile (i.e. it often differs from lexeme to lexeme whether it is possible or just dispreferred for an agent to be expressed).

## Voice {#sec:intro-voice}

### Formal marking of diathesis

The actual linguistic marking of a diathesis, for example by verbal morphology or auxiliaries, is called ~~grammatical voice~~ [following @zuniga2019: 4]. The different kinds of grammatical voice in German are the basic organisational framework of this book. Each chapter discusses a specific kind of grammatical voice, listing all diatheses using that marking. The nine main chapters can be grouped into four kinds of grammatical voices:

- zero-marked 'covert' diatheses (Chapters [-@sec:case; -@sec:prepositions])
- diatheses marked by reflexive pronouns (Chapter [-@sec:reflexive])
- diatheses marked by adverbials or preverbs (Chapters [-@sec:preverbs; -@sec:adverbials])
- diatheses marked by light-verb constructions (Chapters [-@sec:participle; -@sec:infinitive; -@sec:zuinfinitive; -@sec:zuminfinitive])

The first two chapters deal with diatheses that are not overtly marked as such, i.e. they deal with 'covert' diatheses. Because there is no marking on either of the two alternants, it is often difficult to discern a direction in such equipollent alternations. In Chapter [-@sec:case] I will discuss diatheses that only differ in the marking of case, for example unmarked anticausatives like [@Next]. Chapter [-@sec:prepositions] deals with unmarked diatheses in which at least on of the alternants is a prepositional phrase, for example unmarked antipassive like [@NNext].

:::ex
a.  Er verbrennt den Tisch.
b.  Der Tisch verbrennt.
:::

:::ex
a.  Ich schlürfe meinen Tee.
b.  Ich schlürfe an meinem Tee.
:::

The contribution of reflexive pronouns for the marking of diathesis is discussed in Chapter [-@sec:reflexive]. A central claim in this chapter is that 'self inflicting' reflexive reference [@Next] does not count as diathesis in German. In contrast, there are various constructions in German that use reflexive pronouns without such 'self inflicting' reflexive reference, like the antipassive in [@NNext]. In such diatheses the presence of a reflexive pronoun is the actual marking of the diathesis, it is not signalling that subject and object are the same participant. An important generalisation about diatheses with reflexive pronouns is that they are always demotions.

:::ex
a.  Ich wasche das Auto.
b.  Ich wasche mich.
:::

:::ex
a.  Ich fürchte den Tod.
b.  Ich fürchte mich vor den Tod.
:::

In Chapter [-@sec:preverbs] I will turn to preverbs, i.e. verbal prefixes that in German grammar are known as *Verbpräfixe* and *Verbpartikeln*. Grammatically, these are different kinds of prefixes, but from the perspective of diathesis they appear to function rather similar. The most widespread diathesis marked by such preverbs is an applicative, like with *be-* in [@Next]. Because of the bound morphological structure, these diathesis show a strong tendency to grammaticalise into a large variety of different kinds of diatheses. A central generalisation of the diatheses discussed in this chapter is that the resulting sentences structures after diathesis are mostly transitive (esp. nominative + accusative).

:::ex
a.  Ich steige auf den Berg.
b.  Ich besteige den Berg.
:::

Closely related to preverbs are resultative adverbials that induce diathesis, like the applicative with *leer* in [@Next], discussed in Chapter [-@sec:adverbials]. Also using adverbials, but of a completely different kind, are diatheses with depictive adverbials, like the anticausative with *gut* in [@NNext]. Although these two kinds of adverbials occur in rather different kinds of diathesis, both phenomena are combined into the same chapter on adverbially marked diatheses.

:::ex
a.  Ich habe in den Teich gefischt.
b.  Ich habe den Teich leergefischt.
:::

:::ex
a.  Ich fahre den Lastwagen.
b.  Der Lastwagen fährt sich gut.
:::

A large group of diatheses uses light verbs in combination with a non-finite form of the lexical verb. A somewhat surprising insight resulting is that light-verb diatheses always involve a role-change of the nominative subject.

I distinguish four different kinds of light verb constructions, to be discussed in four different chapters. Chapter [-@sec:participle] discusses light verb construction with participles, like the infamous *werden* passive [@Next].

:::ex
a.  Ich habe einen Brief geschrieben.
b.  Der Brief wurde geschrieben.
:::

The next three chapters describe different combinations of light verbs with lexical verbs in the infinitive. Chapter [-@sec:infinitive] discusses light verbs with straight infinitives, like the *lassen* causative [@Next]. 

:::ex
a.  Ich wasche meine Kleider.
b.  Sie lässt mich meine Kleider waschen.
:::

Chapter [-@sec:zuinfinitive] investigates light verbs with *zu* plus infinitive, like the *sein* anticausative [@Next]. And finally, Chapter [-@sec:zuminfinitive] looks at the combinations with *zum* plus infinitive, like the *bringen* causative [@NNext].

:::ex
a.  Ich führe einen Hund an der Leine.
b.  Ein Hund ist an der Leine zu führen.
:::

:::ex
a.  Ich weine. 
b.  Sie bringt mich zum Weinen. 
:::

### Stacking of diatheses

Different diatheses can be applied one after the other, forming ~~stacks~~ of diatheses. Such stacked diatheses can lead to convoluted role-remappings. A beautiful example of such stacking of diatheses is given by Dixon [-@dixon2014: 252] for the Amazonian language Paumarí. Here, the root *noki-* 'to see' is transparently related to the meaning 'to show' through a series of derivational diatheses, viz. *noki-a-* 'to be visible', *na-noki-a-* 'to become visible', and finally *na-noki-a-hi-* 'to make become visible' i.e. 'to show'. 

German does not have that many morphologically bound mechanisms for diathesis, though there are incidental examples that come close. For example, the verb *liegen* 'to lie' changes with ablaut to *legen* 'to lay' (see [@sec:case-umlaut-causative]), which in turn can take a preverb to form *be-legen* 'to cover' (see [@sec:preverb-applicative-antipassive]). However, when the perspective is broadened beyond bound morphology and all different kinds of German diatheses are considered, then it turns out that stacking of diatheses is extremely widespread.

In many cases, the different steps in a stack can be easily disentangled by carefully observing the formal marking of the diathesis. For example, the construction in [@Next c] includes both a preverb *be-* and a reflexive pronoun *sich* and it turns out that these are applied in turn to make a stack of two diatheses. Starting with the verb *antworten* 'to answer' with a governed preposition *auf* [@Next a], the preverb *be-* changes the prepositional phrase to an accusative [@Next b], see [@sec:preverb-applicative]. Subsequently, the reflexive anticausative turns the accusative into a nominative and drops the nominative agent [@Next c], see [@sec:reflexive-anticausative].

:::ex
a.  Der Lehrer antwortet auf deine Frage.
b.  Der Lehrer beantwortet deine Frage.
c.  Deine Frage beantwortet sich von selbst.
:::

With unmarked ('covert') diatheses such stacks can sometimes be tricky to tease apart. As an example, consider the arguably somewhat artificially constructed example in [@Next] using the verb *schneiden* 'to cut'. It starts off in [@Next a] as a basic transitive construction with a nominative and accusative argument. Yet, after various twists and turns it ends up on [@Next g] with a nominative, two accusatives, a dative and an obligatory locational prepositional phrase.

:::ex
a.  Der Arzt schneidet den Nagel des Patienten.
b.  Der Arzt schneidet in den Nagel des Patienten.
c.  Der Arzt schneidet dem Patienten in den Nagel.
d.  Der Arzt schneidet dem Patienten einen Schlitz in den Nagel.
e.  Der Arzt schneidet dem Patienten einen Schlitz in den Nagel mit dem Fräser.
f.  Der Fräser schneidet dem Patienten einen Schlitz in den Nagel.
f.  Der Assistent lässt den Fräser dem Patienten einen Schlitz in den Nagel schneiden.
:::

Teasing this stack apart, there are six different diatheses, concurrently showing that the verb *schneiden* has at least six different lexeme-specific roles. As defined in [@sec:intro-lexical-roles], each role that appears as a case-marked constituent in at least one diathesis is a lexeme-specific role, and all of the following participants are case-marked in the stack of diatheses [@Last]:

- the cutter *Arzt* 'physician'
- the cut object *Nagel* 'nail'
- the possessor of the cut object *Patient* 'patient'
- the result of the cutting *Schlitz* 'groove, slit'
- the instrument doing the cutting *Fräser* 'milling cutter'
- the causer of cutting action *Assistent* 'assistant'

The six diatheses (and the corresponding role-remappings) are the following:

- [@Last b], *in* antipassive: changing the cut object *Nagel* from accusative to prepositional object, see [@sec:prepositions-in-antipassive].
- [@Last c], possessor raising: changing the possessor of the cut object *Patient* from adnominal genitive into dative, see [@sec:prepositions-possessor-of-location-to-dative-experiencer].
- [@Last d], resultative: adding a new accusative object *Schlitz* as the result of the cutting, see [@sec:prepositions-action-result].
- [@Last e], adjunct addition: adding an optional instrument *Fräser*, see [@sec:prepositions-comitative-intrumental].
- [@Last f], instrument anticausative: turning the instrument *Fräser* from prepositional phrase to nominative, see [@sec:prepositions-transitive-conciliative].
- [@Last g], *lassen + Infinitiv* causative: adding a new causer *Assistent* and demoting the nominative *Fräser* to accusative, see [@sec:infinitive-lassen-causative].

### Fixed stacks

There are a few examples of diatheses that look like stacks of two diatheses, but on closer inspection it turns out that the intermediate construction does not exist. A few major examples of such ~~fixed stacks~~ are exemplified below.

There is an infamous anticausative diathesis that needs a reflexive pronoun, which is attested for a large, but restricted group of verbs like *schließen* 'to close' [@Next a,b], see [@sec:reflexive-anticausative]. A completely different group of verbs also has an anticausative diathesis with a reflexive pronoun, but only with an additional evaluative adverbial. This is for example attested with *verkaufen* 'to sell' [@Next c,d], see [@sec:adverbial-reflexive-transitive-anticausative]. In this case, the diathesis is marked by both the reflexive pronoun and the presence of an adverbial, and neither is possible without the other. Such a combination of two obligatorily co-occurring formal marking strategies is called a ~~fixed stack~~.

:::ex
a.  Ich schließe die Tür.
b.  Die Tür schließt sich.
c.  Ich verkaufe das Buch.
d.  Das Buch verkauft sich gut.
:::

Various diatheses between a bare verb, like *fassen* 'to grasp' [@Next a], and a preverb-alternant, like *befassen* 'to be concerned with' [@Next b], additionally need a reflexive pronoun, see [@sec:preverb-reflexive-antipassive]. So here we have a fixed stack of a reflexive pronoun and a preverb together that mark the diathesis.

:::ex
a.  Ich fasse einen Entschluss. 
b.  Ich befasse mich mit dem Entschluss.
:::

Also some light verb alternations show fixed stacks. For example, there is a very widespread causative diathesis using the light verb *lassen* with an infinitive [@Next b], see [@sec:infinitive-lassen-causative]. Additionally, the combination of *lassen + Infinitiv* and a reflexive pronoun leads to an anticausative alternation [@Next c], which does not make sense as being derived from the causative [@Next b]. It seems better to consider the combination of *lassen + Infinitiv + Reflexiv* as a fixed stack, see [@sec:infinitive-lassen-reflexive-anticausative].

:::ex
a.  Der Schüler löst die Aufgabe.
b.  Der Lehrer lässt den Schüler die Aufgabe lösen.
c.  Diese Aufgabe lässt sich lösen.
:::

Similarly, the alternation using the light verb *gehen + zu + Infinitiv* necessarily needs an additional evaluative adverb or negation [@Next], see [@sec:zuinfinitive-gehen-adverb]. The light verb construction does not seem possible without the adverbial [@Next c].

## Diathetical operations {#sec:intro-diathetical-operations}

### Abbreviations used

A diathetical operation is change that happens in the marking of the participants in a diathesis. One of the central definitional properties of a diathesis is that the coding of at least one of the participants has to change, for example a participant erstwhile coded with an accusative turns into a prepositional phrase. Because the role of the participant remains the same (again, by definition), such a change amounts to the mapping of a role onto a different grammatical form. I will call this process ~~role-remapping~~.

In the analysis of diathetical operations in this book I will use the following abbreviations, as summarised in [@fig:abbreviations]. First, ~~grammatical expressions~~, i.e. actual grammatical forms as identified in traditional German grammar, are abbreviated with single letters, shown at the right side of the figure. For case-marked noun phrases I will use the easily recognizable capital letters 'NADG' for nominative, accusative, dative and genitive respectively. As argued earlier (see [@sec:intro-arguments-utterance-valency]) there are also prepositional phrases that express lexically-determined roles. These will also be abbreviated with capital letters: 'L' for obligatory locations and 'P' for governed prepositional phrases.

![Abbreviations used to describe role-remapping](figures/abbreviations.png){#fig:abbreviations}

Lower-cased letters are used for non-argument participants in the clause: 'p' for non-governed prepositional phrases and 'g' for adnominal genitives. Absence of a specific role with be indicated by a '–' dash. Lower-cased 'a' and 'd' are only used in [@sec:reflexive-no-diathesis] to indicate accusative and dative reflexive pronouns in referential usage. As described in much detail in that chapter, it is important to distinguish between reflexive pronouns in German that refer to a lexical role (i.e. 'referential' or 'real' reflexive constructions) and reflexive pronouns that mark a diathesis without referring to a role themselves. Those latter reflexive pronouns are not marking any roles, so they are not abbreviated by lowercased 'a' or 'd'.

Besides single-letter abbreviations I will also use capitalised three-letter abbreviations for a more abstract level of analysis. As summarised at the left side of [@fig:abbreviations], the grammatical expressions are grouped into sets of ~~grammatical macroroles~~, mostly along familiar lines. This grouping is not necessarily the best or most optimal grouping, but this grouping has emerged to be useful to organise the large diversity of diatheses in this book. The notion ~~subject (SBJ)~~ is used for governed nominative phrases that show agreement with the finite verb.^[There are various other nominatively-marked phrases in German grammar which are not included under this heading, e.g. the nominative in nominal or equational predication like *der Täter* in *Er ist der Täter*.] The other case-marked governed phrases are combined as ~~cased objects (OBJ)~~. Together with the ~~prepositional objects (PBJ)~~ they form a superclass of objects. Non-governed phrases are separated in ~~overtly expressed adjuncts (ADJ)~~ and unexpressed roles ~~(Ø)~~. Although I will use this five-way distinction throughout this book ~~(SBJ, OBJ, PBJ, ADJ, Ø)~~, the five steps are not equidistant. The macro-roles ~~OBJ~~ and ~~PBJ~~ are rather closely related, and likewise are ~~ADJ~~ and ~~Ø~~ intimately linked. Collapsing these pairs results in the traditional subject-object-adjunct distinction. 

It is imperative to realise that the macroroles are defined in a language-specific way for German grammar as groupings of language-specific German expressions (e.g. ADJ is defined as being either a non-governed prepositional phrase or an adnominal genitive). The names that are used (e.g. 'object' or 'adjunct') deliberately conjure up general cross-linguistic associations, but it remains to be seen whether similar definitions as used here are also useful for other languages. I will refrain from any cross-linguistic speculation in this context here.

### Remapping of roles {#sec:intro-remapping}

Using the abbreviations as summarised in [@fig:abbreviations] I will organise and categorise the role-remapping of all diatheses in various levels of abstraction. These different categorisations inform the practical organisation of each chapter.

**~~Level 1: diathesis~~**. Each diathesis is summarised in its own sub-subsection. The establishment of an individual diathesis is not always obvious, and each diathesis in this book is already an conscious categorisation (which could be wrong). It has actually been a voyage of discovery in the preparation of this book to decide when to consider a set of examples to be a single diathesis. Very often erstwhile single diatheses turned out to be better analysed by a split into various different diatheses. Although I am rather confident in the quality of the current decisions, I expect that further refinements are necessary in the future.

**~~Level 2: remapping pattern~~**. The role-remapping of each diathesis is analysed using the single-letter abbreviations (NADGPLpgad–) from [@fig:abbreviations]. A remapping is specified as an ordered listing of grammatical expressions for roles, both before and after the diathesis. For example, [NA|–N] is a diathesis that involves two roles that are marked 'NA' before the diathesis and '–N' after the diathesis. Because there are many diatheses with this same pattern, this characterisation is already an (implicit) classification.

**~~Level 3: local group~~**. Groups of diatheses with similar semantics within each chapter are grouped together as a local group. These groups are rather ad-hoc and mainly represent a convenience-summary to streamline the presentation. Local groups are unnumbered subsections, indicated graphically with dashes around the name of the local group.

**~~Level 4: macrorole pattern~~**. The remapping of each local group is structurally analysed in terms of the three-letter macroroles ~~(SBJ, OBJ, PBJ, ADJ, Ø)~~ from [@fig:abbreviations]. For example, the remapping from above [NA|–N] includes both a change from N to zero (i.e. ~~SBJ~~ > ~~Ø~~) and a change from A to N (i.e. ~~OBJ~~ > ~~SBJ~~). These two macrorole changes can be combined into a single macrorole patter ~~[OBJ>SBJ>Ø]~~.

**~~Level 5: promotion/demotion~~**. On the most abstract level, all diatheses are separated into chapter-subsections of either demotion or promotion (with only very few diatheses being symmetrical exchanges). Basically, each remapping is evaluated on the macrorole hierarchy [@Next] with role-remapping upwards being promotion and role-remapping downward being demotion. Note that there is a crucial additional criterion necessary, because the majority of diatheses consist of chains of two coinciding remappings (see [@sec:intro-chaining]). In such remappings, the largest jump on the macrorole hierarchy defines a diathesis as being demotion or promotion. When both jumps are equally large, then the diathesis is ~~symmetrical~~.

:::ex
Macrorole Hierarchy: ~~SBJ >> OBJ >> PBJ >> ADJ >> Ø~~
:::

For example, the diathesis in [@Next] will be analysed as a ~~remapping pattern~~ [NA|–N], see [@sec:reflexive-anticausative]. This should be read as follows: there is an alternation between a clause with 'NA' arguments (nominative, accusative) and a clause with only 'N' marking (nominative). The relative order of these letters is crucial, as the order of the roles remains fixed in this notation, e.g. the second letter on the left 'A' (accusative) corresponds to the second letter on the right 'N' (nominative). The '–' dash on the right indicates that the corresponding 'N' on the left is not expressed. Note that the actual linear arrangement of the letters is flexible, as long as both sides of the alternation remain in the same order, i.e. [AN|N–] would be the same remapping pattern as [NA|–N]. The pattern [NA|–N] is an implicit categorisation, because there are many other diatheses that have exactly the same pattern (see e.g. [@sec:case-haben-anticausative; @sec:adverbial-reflexive-transitive-anticausative; @sec:participles-sein-zustandspassiv]).

:::ex
a.  Ich schließe die Tür.
b.  Die Tür schließt sich. 
:::

Although there is a reflexive pronoun in [@Last b], this pronoun is not included with a lower-cased 'a' in the remapping pattern [NA|–N], because this reflexive pronoun does not refer to a separate role. The verb *schließen* 'to close' implies at least two different roles, the 'closer' and the 'closed object', expressed as nominative and accusative in [@Last a], respectively. In [@Last b] only the role of 'closed object' is expressed as nominative. The reflexive pronoun does not refer to any other role.

I interpret the reflexive pronoun in [@Last] as a marker of the diathesis itself (see Chapter [-@sec:reflexive] for an extensive discussion), so there is an overt direction in the markedness from [@Last a] to [@Last b]. The '|' bar in the middle of the remapping pattern [NA|–N] implies this direction in markedness, i.e. left side describes the unmarked alternant and the right the marked alternant. Reordering the remapping pattern would result in a completely reversed diathesis [—N|NA].

The diathesis in [@Last] is one of various examples of a ~~local group~~ called 'reflexive antipassive'. Other diatheses in this group include examples like [@Next] with an additional governed preposition, analysed with the remapping pattern [NAP|–NP], see [@sec:reflexive-anticausative-governed-preposition]. All diatheses in this local group have the same ~~macrorole pattern~~, namely ~~[OBJ>SBJ>Ø]~~, i.e a cased object is turned into nominative subject, which is turned into zero (i.e. unexpressed).

This diathesis is a combination of two different remappings ~~[OBJ>SBJ]~~ and ~~[SBJ>Ø]~~, with the first being a promotion on the macrorole hierarchy and the second a demotion. However, because the second remapping ~~[SBJ>Ø]~~ is a larger jump on the hierarchy, the complete combination is categorised as a ~~demotion~~.

:::ex
a.  Das Lied erinnert den Mann an den Krieg.
b.  Der Mann erinnert sich an den Krieg.
:::

So, in summary, the role-remapping in the diathesis [@Last] is categorised as:

1. ~~Diathesis~~: reflexive antipassive + governed preposition
2. ~~Remapping Pattern~~: ~~[ NAP | –NP ]~~
3. ~~Local Group~~: reflexive antipassive
4. ~~Macrorole Pattern~~: ~~[ OBJ > SBJ > Ø ]~~
5. ~~Promotion/Demotion~~: demotion

## Chaining {#sec:intro-chaining}

### Isolated diatheses

Many diatheses just remap a single role. Such sole diatheses are called ~~isolated diatheses~~ here. However, there are also many diatheses in which more than one role is remapped. I distinguish the following kinds of role-remappings, of which only the first two are frequently attested.

- **Isolated Diathesis**: Only one role changes its formal marking.
- **Chained Diathesis**: Two roles change their formal marking, forming a chain in which one role changes its form from ~~X~~ to ~~Y~~, while the other role changes its form from ~~Y~~ to ~~Z~~. This results in a chain ~~[X > Y > Z]~~.
- **Multi-chained Diathesis**: More than two roles change their formal marking, forming a longer chain of connected changes.
- **Disjunct Diathesis**: Two (or more) roles change their formal marking, with no overlap between marking.

### Chained diatheses

When two roles are remapped by a single diathesis it is surprisingly frequent for them to be chained. In a ~~chained diathesis~~ the resulting form of one remapping is the start of the second. This can be conceptualised as a 'push' chain in which one remapping induces another because German grammar strongly disprefers multiple constituents of the same kind (e.g. two accusatives) in the same clause.

Chained diatheses typically occur when the nominative subject is involved in the diathesis. There can only be a single nominative subject in a German clause, and it is highly unusual to have a sentence without a nominative subject. This implies that any diathesis involving the nominative subject typically includes two remappings, namely one from something else to nominative and a second remapping of the erstwhile nominative to something else.

A prototypical example of a chained diathesis involving the nominative subject is the *werden* passive [@Next]. Here, the erstwhile accusative *Kuchen* 'cake' is turned into a nominative, while the erstwhile nominative *Lehrling* 'apprentice' is removed (or optionally retained as a *von* prepositional phrase). So, we have a chain consisting of the role-remappings ~~[OBJ>SBJ]~~ and ~~[SBJ>ADJ]~~.

:::ex
[ OBJ > SBJ > ADJ ]

a.  Der Lehrling backt den Kuchen.
b.  Der Kuchen wird gebacken (von den Lehrling).
:::

Diatheses without involvement of the nominative subject are more flexible, in that both isolated and chained diatheses are common. A typical example of a chained diathesis is a full applicative induces by the preverb *be-* [@Next]. In this example, a prepositional phrase *für ihre Freundin* 'for her friend' is remapped to an accusative ~~[ADJ>OBJ]~~ while the erstwhile accusative *Essen* 'food' is turned into a prepositional phrase ~~[OBJ>ADJ]~~.

:::ex
[ ADJ > OBJ > ADJ ]

a.  Sie kochte kubanisches Essen für ihre Freundin.
b.  Sie bekocht ihre Freundin mit kubanischem Essen.
:::

Among chained diatheses there is a group of frequently recurring remapping patterns. Because of their frequency, it is highly useful to give them specific names. Such names are widespread in the literature, e.g. anticausative for ~~[OBJ>SBJ>Ø]~~ or passive for ~~[OBJ>SBJ>ADJ]~~. A survey of the various names used in this book will be pursued in [@sec:intro-naming].

### Multi-chained diatheses

~~multi-chained diatheses~~ consist of combinations of more than two role-remappings that occur in a sequence. This occurs frequently as the result of a stack of multiple diatheses, but only very rarely in a single diathesis. As an example arising from a stack of multiple diatheses consider taking a verb like *lesen* 'to read' [@Next a] and applying a stack of two diatheses [@Next b,c]. This leads to a chain of three role-remappings. First, the preverb diathesis with *vor-* [@Next b] leads to the addition of a dative argument *dem Jungen*, i.e. a role-remapping ~~[Ø>OBJ]~~, see [@sec:preverb-dative-additions]. On top of that, the *bekommen* dative passive [@Next c] promotes this dative to subject and removes the original subject, i.e. a role-remapping ~~[OBJ>SBJ>Ø]~~, see [@sec:participles-bekommen-passive]. Combined, these two diatheses lead to a role-remapping ~~[Ø>OBJ>SBJ>Ø]~~.

:::ex
[ Ø > OBJ > SBJ > Ø ]

a.  Der Vater hat ein Buch gelesen.
b.  Der Vater hat dem Jungen ein Buch vorgelesene.
c.  Der Junge bekommt ein Buch vorgelesen.
:::

Such multi-chained diatheses resulting from diathesis-stacking are widespread. However, I know of only two diatheses with a multi-chain that cannot be decomposed into a stack of separate diatheses. Both these 'fixed' multi-chain diatheses appear to occur with just a few idiosyncratic verbs, so this phenomenon really seems to be dispreferred in German.

First, the preverb diathesis from *erben* 'to inherit' to *enterben* 'to disinherit' [@Next], see [@sec:preverb-inverted-passive-accusative-loss], contains three linked role-remappings for (i) the originator of the inheritance *Vater* 'father' ~~[ADJ>SBJ]~~, (ii) the receiver of the inheritance *Junge* 'boy' ~~[SBJ>OBJ]~~ and (iii) the inheritance *Schreibtisch* 'desk' ~~[OBJ>Ø]~~.

:::ex
[ ADJ > SBJ > OBJ > Ø ]

a.  Der Junge erbt den Schreibtisch von seinem Vater.
b.  Sein Vater enterbt den Jungen.
:::

Second, the verb *schmecken* 'to taste' [@Next], see [@sec:prepositions-ingredient-anticausative], allows for two different constructions with three linked role-remappings for (i) the tasted substance *Pfefferminze* 'peppermint' ~~[OBJ>ADJ]~~, (ii) the tasted dish *Suppe* 'soup' ~~[ADJ>SBJ]~~ and (iii) the taster *Koch* 'cook' ~~[SBJ>Ø]~~.

:::ex
[ OBJ > ADJ > SBJ > Ø ]

a.  Der Koch schmeckt die Pfefferminze in der Suppe.
b.  Die Suppe schmeckt nach Pfefferminze
:::

### Disjunct diatheses

~~disjunct diatheses~~ consist of a combination of multiple role-remappings that are not linked to each other. Just as with the multi-chained diatheses from the previous section, disjunct diatheses regularly occur as the result of stacking of diatheses. In contrast, they are very rare in individual diatheses.

When multiple diatheses are stacked, i.e. whey they are applied sequentially on top of each other, they are often structurally independent. For example, the verb *waschen* 'to wash' [@Next a] can be used in a resultative construction [@Next b] in which the role of washee *Hemd* 'shirt' is turned from an accusative into a location ~~[OBJ>PBJ]~~ and a new accusative object is introduced for the role of the result *Fleck* 'stain' ~~[Ø>OBJ]~~, see [@sec:prepositions-action-result]. Independent of this chained diathesis, the possessor of the object *Nachbar* 'neighbour' can be raised to genitive [@Next c], see [@sec:prepositions-possessor-of-location-to-dative-experiencer-accusative].

:::ex
[ Ø > OBJ > PBJ, ADJ > OBJ ]

a.  Ich wasche das Hemd des Nachbarn.
b.  Ich wasche den Fleck aus dem Hemd des Nachbarn.
c.  Ich wasche dem Nachbarn den Fleck aus dem Hemd.
:::

There are only a few incidental examples of such disjunct diatheses without stacking. The following four examples all only occur with a very limited number of verbs. First, the verb *deuten* can be used both the mean 'interpret' [@Next a] and 'forebode' [@Next b] with a rather transparent connection between the two. However, the role-remappings are quite complex, see [@sec:prepositions-anticausative-preposition-addition].

:::ex
[ Ø > PBJ, OBJ > SBJ > Ø ]

a.  Ich deute den Traum. 
b.  Der Traum deutet auf nichts Gutes. 
:::

Second, some preverbs lead to disjunct diatheses, like with *schweigen* 'to remain silent' and *verschweigen* 'to conceal' [@Next], see [@sec:preverb-double-applicative].

:::ex
[ ADJ > OBJ, PBJ > OBJ ]

a.  Ich schweige zu dir über meinen Besuch.
b.  Ich verschweige dir meinen Besuch.
:::

Further examples are resultatives for a few verbs of naming like *schimpfen* 'to scold' [@Next], see [@sec:prepositions-naming-result]. The disjunct diathesis in [@NNext] is less clear, as it might be better analysed as a stack, see [@sec:prepositions-nominative-demotion-dative-addition].

:::ex
[ Ø > OBJ, ADJ > OBJ ]

a.  Sie schimpft auf mich.
b.  Sie schimpft mich einen Narren
:::

:::ex
[ Ø > OBJ, SBJ > ADJ ]

a.  Der Sommer ist kalt.
b.  Mir ist kalt im Sommer.
:::

The only somewhat more widespread disjunct diathesis is the resultative construction that can arise with some apparently intransitive verbs like *schwitzen* 'to sweat' [@Next]. This diathesis introduces two roles at once: a result *Fleck* 'stain' and an obligatory location *Hemd* 'shirt', see [@sec:prepositions-intransitive-location-as-result].

:::ex
[ Ø > OBJ, Ø > PBJ ]

a.  Ich schwitze.
b.  Ich schwitze einen Fleck in meinem Hemd.
:::

## Naming {#sec:intro-naming}

### Names for macroroles patterns

Throughout this chapter, I have used various names for diatheses, like passive, antipassive, applicative or causative. These names have a long history in the grammatical literature [cf. @melcuk1993; @wunderlich1993; @wunderlich2015; @dixon2000a; @dixon2014; @haspelmath2004c; @kulikov2011; @malchukov2015: 96ff.; @zuniga2019]. Although I have been using these terms as if their meaning is clear, this is often far from the case. Many different terms and definitions have been proposed in the literature, and different terms have at times been used for the same phenomena. For example, the original proposal for the term 'antipassive' is already 50 years old [@silverstein1972: 395], but the same phenomenon is also known as deaccusative [@geniusiene1987: 94] or antiapplicative [@haspelmath2004c: 1132; @scheibl2006: 371]. Reversely, antipassive is also attested referring to a slightly different phenomenon of the drop of an object [@scheibl2006: 372-373]. 

In this section I will describe in more detail how these names are used and defined in the current book about German diatheses. The names for diatheses will here always refer to a macrorole pattern, i.e. to the highly abstract classification of a diathesis in terms of ~~SBJ~~, ~~OBJ~~, etc. as defined in [@sec:intro-remapping]. For example, the term 'anticausative' will be used as a name for the macrorole pattern ~~[OBJ>SBJ>Ø]~~. Such macrorole patterns are strictly defined here in a language-specific way for German, so care should be taken when applying the same names to different languages.

One widespread term that I will avoid is the term 'middle' (and likewise the Latinate equivalent term 'medium'). This term for a diathesis is already attested as *μεσότης* in the oldest known Greek grammatical text, the *τέχνη γραμματική* of Dionysius Thrax, and it has become a mainstay in the grammatical literature ever since.^[Thrax writes: *διαθέσεις εἰσὶ τρεῖς, ἐνέργεια, πάθος, μεσότης* "there are three diatheses, active, passive and middle" [@uhlig1883: 48].] The phenomena that are called 'middle' in the literature are highly variable, and there is no consensus about what kind of diathesis this term is supposed to designate, other than something that is neither active nor passive [see @zuniga2019: 168-177 for a thorough summary of the complex philological history of the term middle/medium]. Such a broad and ill-defined term is not useful for a detailed analysis of the large variety of attested role-remappings in German.

The discussion about the different names for macrorole patterns will be split into four parts. First, the following two sections will present names for diatheses involving the nominative subject. Subsequent sections will discuss diatheses not involving the subject. In both discussions, a central distinction will be made between isolated diatheses and chained diatheses (see [@sec:intro-chaining]).

### Isolated subject diatheses

Isolated diatheses that involve a nominative subject are not widespread in German. The only clearly attested kind is the drop of the subject ~~[SBJ>Ø]~~, i.e. the complete removal of the role marked as nominative subject without any further accompanying role-remapping or reintroduction of a new subject. This is typically attested with intransitive verbs: after removing the single available role, there is no other role introduced to fill the structural subject position. Semantically, such diatheses put the focus on the activity as described by the verb itself, so I propose to call them ~~verbative~~ diatheses. Note that there is a strong tendency for every German sentence to formally have a nominative subject with verb agreement. Consequently, such verbative diatheses almost always result in the presence of a valency-simulating nominative pronoun *es* (see [@sec:intro-es]). 

A ~~verbative~~ diathesis is attested with verbs like *stinken* 'to stink' [@Next], see [@sec:case-nominative-drop]. In a sentence like *es stinkt* the pronoun *es* can of course simply be an anaphor, like in [@Next b]. In such a sentence, the role of 'stinker' is still present and there is no diathesis at all. However, in other contexts [@Next c] the verb *stinken* is used without implied subject. This is typically attested in contexts in which some odour is attested, but the originator is not known.

:::ex
a.  Der Müll stinkt.
b.  Das schmutzige Tuch, es stinkt!
c.  Hier stinkt es.
:::

Another example of a verbative diathesis is illustrated with the verb *leben* 'to live' [@Next]. Many sich intransitive verbs can be used without a subject in a habitual sense, but this is only possible with an obligatory adverbial qualification like *gut* [@Next b,c], see [@sec:adverbial-reflexive-drop].

:::ex
a.  Ich lebe in diesem Haus.
b.  In diesem Haus lebt es sich gut.
c.  ^* In diesem Haus lebt es sich.
:::

Also the so-called impersonal passive [@Next] is an example of a verbative diathesis, in this case even without any valency-simulating *es*, see [@sec:participles-werden-impersonal-passive].

:::ex
a.  Die Jungs tanzen hier.
b.  Hier wird getanzt.
c.  ^* Hier wird es getanzt.
:::

Other isolated diatheses are only attested in incidental examples in German. An isolated ~~subject demotion~~ of the subject to a governed preposition ~~[SBJ>PBJ]~~ is shown in [@Next], see [@sec:prepositions-nominative-demotion].

:::ex
a.  Das Geld fehlt ihm.
b.  Ihm fehlt es an Geld.
:::

Isolated ~~subject addition [Ø>SBJ]~~ is very rare in German, partly because it would need an unmarked construction without any subject to start off with. A possible example is the addition of a subject, which seems possible with some weather verbs like *donnern* 'to thunder' [@Next], see [@sec:case-nominative-addition].

:::ex
a.  Es donnert. 
b.  Die Motoren donnerten.
:::

### Chained subject diatheses

Chained diatheses that involve the nominative subject are widespread in German (in contrast to the infrequent occurrence of isolated diatheses as discussed previously). [@fig:subjectchains] presents an overview of the different terms that I will use for these diatheses. The bold-faced terms are used for widely attested diatheses, while the other kinds of diatheses are only incidentally found. There is currently no evidence in German for the remappings that are left empty in the figure. There appears to be a preference for various kinds of demotion (i.e. the upper right corner of the figure), which fits nicely with the known typological preference of German for anticausative constructions [@haspelmath1993a: 101; @nichols2004: 189].

![Names for chained macro-role remappings involving the subject](figures/subjectchains.png){#fig:subjectchains}

The upper right triangle of [@fig:subjectchains] are demotions, the lower left triangle are promotions, and the diagonal are examples of symmetrical diatheses. I will discuss all types in this order.

#### Demotions {.unnumbered}

The most extreme kind of demotion is an ~~anticausative [OBJ>SBJ>Ø]~~. The typical characteristic of an anticausative is the complete removal of the nominative subject that is the causer of the action/state of the clause. Filling the syntactic gap, a case-marked argument (typically the accusative) is promoted to subject. This is a widespread kind of diathesis. An example is the reflexive anticausative with verb like *schliessen* 'to close' [@Next], see [@sec:reflexive-anticausative].

:::ex
a.  Ich schließe die Tür.
b.  Die Tür schließt sich (von alleine). 
:::

Very similar an anticausative is the ~~passive [OBJ>SBJ>ADJ]~~. The main difference between the two (a distinction which is often difficult to delimit) is that for a passive the original subject is still implied and can optionally be overtly expressed [@Next]. In contrast, for an anticausative the original subject is completely removed and a phrase like "by itself" can typically be added. As an example of a passive diathesis in [@Next] I present not the typical *werden + Partizip* passive, but a less widely acknowledged *glauben + Reflexiv + Partizip* passive diathesis, see [@sec:participle-glauben-reflexive].

:::ex
a.  Der Vater hat seine Tochter nicht geliebt.
b.  Die Tochter glaubte sich von ihrem Vater nicht geliebt.
:::

A ~~conversive [OBJ>SBJ>PBJ]~~ looks similar to a passive, except that the prepositional phrase is a lexically governed preposition, so it has a more object-like grammatical status. An example is the verb *empören* 'to appall' [@Next a] with the reflexive diathesis *sich empören über* 'to be outraged about' [@Next b,c], see [@sec:reflexive-preposition-passive]. The term conversive is adapted from Kulikov [-@kulikov2011: 380].

:::ex
a.  Der Preis empört den Kunden.
b.  Der Kunde empört sich über den Preis.
c.  Der Kunde empört sich darüber, dass der Preis schon wieder gestiegen ist.
:::

For the next diathesis, I propose the term ~~fabricative [PBJ>SBJ>Ø]~~ based on Lat. *fabrica* 'plan, trick, workmanship'. This term is used for a diathesis in German in which a fabricated product can be expressed either as a governed prepositional phrase or as a nominative subject. This diathesis occurs for example with various verbs of emotional interactions like *überraschen* 'to surprise' [@Next a], see [@sec:prepositions-fabricative-accusative]. To understand this diathesis, a distinction is needed between the role of the 'fabricator' (here: *Lehrer*, 'teacher') and the role of the 'fabricated product', which induces the emotion (here: *Aufgabe*, 'assignment'). The *mit* prepositional phrase that expresses the fabricated product in [@Next a] is a governed preposition [@Next c]. The diathesis promotes this fabricated product to nominative subject and the fabricator is removed from the expression [@Next b]. The experiencer in the accusative *mich* remains unchanged.

:::ex
a.  Der Lehrer überraschst mich mit seiner Aufgabe.
b.  Die Aufgabe überrascht mich.
c.  Der Lehrer überrascht mich damit, dass er die Aufgabe schon korrigiert hat.
:::

A similar kind of diathesis is called here a ~~conciliative [ADJ>SBJ>Ø]~~ based on Lat. *conciliator* 'intermediary, mediator'. In a conciliative an external object (typically an instrument) is promoted to subject [@Next], see [@sec:prepositions-transitive-conciliative]. The conciliative and fabricative in German both regularly use a prepositional phrase with *mit*, but the grammatical status is clearly different. The *mit* phrase in a conciliative is an optional adjunct [@Next], while the *mit* phrase in a fabricative is a governed preposition [@Last]. This grammatical difference is paralleled by a functional difference in the role that is promoted to subject: a conciliative concerns a (typically tangible) instrument that is used by an agent, while a fabricative promotes a (typically intangible) creation that is produced by the agent.

:::ex
a.  Der Doktor heilt die Wunde mit einer Salbe.
b.  Die Salbe heilt die Wunde.
:::

#### Promotions {.unnumbered}

The most widespread promotion to subject attested in German is the diathesis with role-remapping ~~[Ø>SBJ>OBJ]~~, called ~~novative~~ here (based on Lat. *novare* 'renew, refresh, change'). This role-remapping is best known as 'causative', but this semantic characterisation does not hold for all examples of this diathesis. Various other novative diatheses exist in which the new nominative is not a causer but an experiencer or a permission giver. 

Semantically, the most widespread kind of novative adds a new causer to the construction, like with the diatheses between *brennen* 'to burn (intrans.)' and *verbrennen* 'to burn (trans.)' [@Next], see [@sec:preverb-causative]. Such a diathesis is aptly called a ~~causative~~.

:::ex
a.  Das Holz brennt.
b.  Ich verbrenne das Holz.
:::

The *sehen + Infinitiv* diathesis [@Next], see [@sec:infinitive-sehen], adds a new nominative subject and the old subject is turned into an accusative. This diathesis is thus structurally an example of a novative ~~[Ø>SBJ>OBJ]~~. However, the newly added nominative is not a causer. The new role is better described as an experiencer, so this diathesis can semantically be called an ~~experientive~~.

:::ex
a.  Der Junge putzt den Tisch.
b.  Meine Mutter sieht den Jungen den Tisch putzen.
:::

Likewise, the *lassen + Infinitiv* diathesis [@Next], see [@sec:infinitive-lassen-causative] is also structurally a novative ~~[Ø>SBJ>OBJ]~~. This diathesis has multiple possible interpretations, among them also a causative reading. However, in the example in [@Next] the newly added nominative is allowing the action to happen, not causing it, so this diathesis can semantically be called a ~~permissive~~. This typically happens with 'unergative' predicates, see [@sec:participles-restrictions].

:::ex
a.  Das Baby schläft.
b.  Ich lasse das Baby schlafen.
:::

<!--
For that reason I will not introduce new terms for these diatheses, but designate them as 'reversed' versions of demotions. For example, the reversal of a passive ~~[OBJ>SBJ>ADJ]~~ is a reversed passive ~~[ADJ>SBJ>OBJ]~~. This naming convention is just a stop-gap introduced for the current analysis of German, because there is not enough positive evidence to provide a thorough analysis of such diatheses. These names should not be interpreted as a semantic analysis, e.g. a reversed passive is semantically not related to the passive at all.
-->
 
A ~~reversed passive [ADJ>SBJ>OBJ]~~ demotes the subject to object and at the same time promotes a new subject from an erstwhile adjunct role. An example in German is the diathesis from *erben* 'to inherit' to *enterben* 'to disinherit' [@Next], see [@sec:preverb-inverted-passive-accusative-loss]. This is semantically very close to a causative ~~[Ø>SBJ>OBJ]~~, in which the newly introduced causer can sometimes be expressed as an adjunct [@NNext]. This affinity between a reversed passive and a causative is reminiscent of the affinity between a passive and an anticausative. In both pairs, the difference amounts to a switch between the closely related macro-role of an optional adjunct ~~(ADJ)~~ and being completely unexpressed ~~(Ø)~~.

Another example of a reversed passive is the *haben + am + Infinitiv* diathesis [@Next], see [@sec:zuminfinitive-haben-am]. The new subject (syntactically the possessor of the old subject) can semantically be interpreted as an experiencer in [@Next b]. Similar, though applicable to a completely different group of verbs, is the *haben + Infinitiv* Diathesis [@NNext], see [@sec:infinitive-haben].

:::ex
a.  Meine Wohnung brennt.
b.  Ich habe die Wohnung am Brennen.
:::

:::ex
a.  Ein Tropfen hängt an seiner Nase.
b.  Er hat einen Tropfen an der Nase hängen.

All other promotions are rare. A ~~reversed conversive [PBJ>SBJ>OBJ]~~ differs from a reversed passive in that the prepositional phrase is a lexically governed preposition, as can be identified by a possible  *da+preposition, dass ...* paraphrase. This is for example attested for the diatheses between *staunen über* 'to marvel' and *erstaunen* 'to amaze' [@Next], see [@sec:preverb-inverted-passives].

:::ex
a.  Ich staune über deine Arbeit.
b.  Deine Arbeit erstaunt mich.
c.  Ich staune darüber, dass du schon fertig bist.
:::

The ~~novative with extended demotion [Ø>SBJ>PBJ]~~ is extremely rare in German. The name is adapted from Kulikov [-@kulikov2011: 388]. The diathesis between *freuen* 'to be pleased' and *erfreuen* 'to please' [@Next] might be an example, see [@sec:preverb-reversed-fabricative].

:::ex
a.  Das Geschenk freut mich.
b.  Er erfreut mich mit einem Geschenk.
:::

#### Symmetrical subject diatheses {.unnumbered}

Symmetrical diatheses involving the subject are rare in German. An ~~inversive [OBJ>SBJ>OBJ]~~ switches subject and object. This term is proposed by Malchukov [-@malchukov2015: 99-100] in reminiscence of the so-called 'inverse' marking found in Algonquian languages. An inversive diathesis is designated as a "symmetric conversive" by Kulikov [-@kulikov2011: 380]. An example of an inversive is the diathesis between *wundern* 'to puzzle' and *bewundern* 'to admire' [@Next], see [@sec:preverb-accusative-inversive].

:::ex
a.  Dein Verhalten wundert mich.
b.  Ich bewundere dein Verhalten.
:::

At the other extreme, a ~~commutative [Ø>SBJ>Ø]~~ complete removes the old subject and introduces a completely new role as subject. I propose this term on the basis of Lat. *commutare* 'exchange, replace'. A German example of such a diathesis is the *wissen + Partizip* construction [@Next], see [@sec:participle-wissen-commutative].

:::ex
a.  Das Archiv hebt den Nachlass auf.
b.  Ich weiß den Nachlass gut aufgehoben.
:::

The two other symmetrical diatheses in between the two extremes are even rarer. A ~~preposition inversive [PBJ>SBJ>PBJ]~~ is similar to an inversive, but the exchange is with a governed preposition. This is arguably attested in the diathesis between *strahlen* 'to shine' and *erstrahlen* 'to gleam' [@Next], see [@sec:prepositions-location-inversive].

:::ex
a.  Die Sonne strahlt auf das Haus.
b.  Das Haus erstrahlt in der Sonne.
:::

Finally, an example of an ~~adjunct commutative [ADJ>SBJ>ADJ]~~ is possibly attested with the verb *wimmeln* 'to swarm' [@Next], see [@sec:prepositions-subject-switch].

:::ex
a.  Die Kinder wimmeln auf den Platz.
b.  Der Platz wimmelt von Kindern. 
:::

### Isolated object diatheses

The situation with object diatheses is reversed from the previously discussed subject diatheses. With object diatheses, isolated diatheses are much more widespread and they occur with a wide variety of role-remappings, see [@fig:objectdiatheses]. In contrast, chained diatheses are less widespread and can always be analysed as a combination of multiple isolated diatheses.

![Names for isolated remappings without involvement of the subject](figures/objectdiatheses.png){#fig:objectdiatheses}^[The lower right part of the figure is left empty because such alternations are not diatheses. The dropping or addition is expected behaviour for an adjunct, and a change from zero to zero amounts to nothing.]

I will discuss the different role-remappings from [@fig:objectdiatheses] in three subsections. First, I will look at the various kinds of applicatives and antipassives, then at the drops and additions, and finally at the symmetrical exchanges on the diagonal.

#### Applicative & antipassive {.unnumbered}

Applicatives and antipassives are very similar, though reversed. ~~applicatives [ADJ>OBJ]~~ change a prepositional phrase into a case-marked phrase, while ~~antipassives [OBJ>ADJ]~~ convert a case-marked phrase into a prepositional phrase. Given this affinity, instead of 'antipassive' it might be better to call such remappings 'antiapplicative' [e.g. @haspelmath2004c: 1132]. However, because the name 'antipassive' is already strongly entrenched in the grammatical literature, I decided not to add to the naming-confusion any more.

Applicatives occur frequently with the addition of a preverb, like in the alternation between *steigen auf* 'to climb' and *besteigen* 'to mount' [@Next], see [@sec:preverb-applicative].

:::ex
a.  Sie steigt auf den Berg.
b.  Sie besteigt den Berg.
:::

Antipassives in German are typically unmarked, like in the alternation between *schießen auf* 'to aim at' and *schießen* 'to shoot' [@Next], see [@sec:prepositions-accusative-antipassive]. Because this alternation is unmarked it is debatable what the direction of the diathesis is. An example with a clear direction is the alternation between *treffen* 'to meet' and *sich treffen mit* 'to meet with [@NNext], see [@sec:reflexive-mit-antipassive].

:::ex
a.  Ich schieße den Bären.
b.  Ich schieße auf den Bären.
:::

:::ex
a.  Ich treffe dich.
c.  Ich treffe mich mit dir.
:::

The object of applicatives and antipassives is typically an accusative, but datives are also attested. An example of a dative applicative is the alternation between *stammen aus* 'to hail from' and *entstammen* 'to be descended from' [@Next], see [@sec:preverb-dative-applicative]. An example of a dative antipassive is the covert alternation of *berichten* 'to report' [@NNext], see  [@sec:prepositions-dative-antipassive-accusative].

:::ex
a.  Ich stamme aus einem Adelsgeschlecht.
b.  Ich entstamme einem Adelsgeschlecht
:::

:::ex
a.  Er berichtet dem Vorstand alles.
b.  Er berichtet alles an den Vorstand.
:::

In the discussion of diatheses in this book I consistently distinguish ~~governed applicatives [PBJ>OBJ]~~ and ~~governed antipassives [OBJ>PBJ]~~ when the prepositional phrase is a governed preposition. An example of a governed applicative is the diathesis between *arbeiten an* 'to work on' (with a governed preposition *an*) and *bearbeiten* 'to edit, adapt' [@Next], see [@sec:preverb-governed-applicative]. An example of a governed antipassive is the diathesis between *beklagen* 'to lament' and *sich beklagen* 'to complain' (with a governed preposition *über*) [@NNext], see [@sec:reflexive-accusative-antipassive]. However, the differentiation between the governed and non-governed applicative/antipassive does not currently allow for any promising semantic of structural generalisations, so this differentiation might grammatically be unnecessary. I have indicated this close affinity graphically in [@fig:objectdiatheses] by surrounding thick lines.

:::ex
a.  Ich arbeite an dem Text.
b.  Ich bearbeite den Text.
:::

:::ex
a.  Ich beklage den Lärm.
b.  Ich beklage mich über den Lärm.
:::

There is a further diathesis with a role-remapping between adjunct and object, namely ~~possessor raising~~. 

#### Addition & drop {.unnumbered}

- **ADDITION**
- **RESULTATIVE: Addition of a new causee as a non-nominative argument.** The typical characteristic of a resultative is the addition of a new causee. Instead of simply expressing the content of a predicate as the action/state of the clause, a resultative diatheses expressed that something is caused by performing the predicate. Note that the term "resultative" is used by [@nedjalkov1988a] with a different meaning (viz. a special kind of anticausative)

- **DROP** "deobjective" [@haspelmath2004c: 1131]
- **ANTIRESULTATIVE**

#### Symmetrical object diatheses {.unnumbered}

Symmetrical object diatheses are rare in German. A ~~case change [OBJ>OBJ]~~ is illustrated by the alternation between *folgen* 'to follow' (with dative) and *verfolgen* 'to chase' (with accusative) [@Next], see [@sec:preverb-dative-accusative].

:::ex
a.  Ich folge dem Auto.
b.  Ich verfolge das Auto.
:::

A ~~governed preposition change [PBJ>PBJ]~~ occurs in a special kind of usage of reflexive pronouns that induces a change in lexical specific prepositions, like *arbeiten an* 'to work on' changing into *sich arbeiten durch* 'to work through' [@Next], see [@sec:reflexive-resultative].

:::ex
a.  Er arbeitet an den Daten. 
b.  Er arbeitet sich durch die Daten.
:::

An ~~adjunct change [ADJ>ADJ]~~ is, according to my definitions, not a diathesis at all, as adjuncts are not lexically specific. However, the change between a possessor and a prepositional phrase as shown in [@Next] can be seen as as a borderline examples, see [@sec:prepositions-possessor-to-preposition].

:::ex
a.  Ich bewundere seine Ehrlichkeit.
b.  Ich bewundere die Ehrlichkeit bei ihm.
:::

### Chained object diathesis

Combinations of isolated diatheses

~~full applicative~~ is a combination of an applicative and an antipassive
