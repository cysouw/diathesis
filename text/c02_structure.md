# The structure of a diathesis {#sec:structure}

## Terminology {#sec:intro-terminology}

In their cross-linguistic survey of diathesis, Zuñiga & Kittilä [-@zuniga2019] distinguish between the terms 'diathesis', 'diathetical operation', 'grammatical voice' and 'transitivity'. I completely subscribe to these conceptual distinctions. However, throughout this book I have decided to simplify the terminology and basically use the term 'diathesis' for all four concepts. Still, the concepts ~~valency~~ ([@sec:intro-valency]), ~~voice~~ ([@sec:intro-voice]), and ~~diathetical operation~~ ([@sec:intro-diathetical-operations]) are central in the analysis of the structure of a diathesis and will be discussed extensively in this chapter. Two new concepts are introduced as well, namely ~~stacking~~ ([@sec:intro-stacking]) and ~~chaining~~ ([@sec:intro-chaining]). Finally, I will present an extensive discussion about ~~naming~~ diatheses ([@sec:intro-naming]).

A diathesis (as defined here) is an alternation between two clausal construction. To be more precise, this is what is called a 'diathetical operation' in Zuñiga & Kittilä [-@zuniga2019: 4], see [@sec:intro-diathetical-operations]. Each of the alternants show a different mapping of (grammatical) expressions onto (semantic) roles. Individually, each such mapping between expressions and roles is called a 'diathesis' in Zuñiga & Kittilä [-@zuniga2019: 4]. However, because I will only consider diathetical operations between an unmarked basic clause and a marked alternant, I have decided to simplify the terminology in this book. Both the alternation itself (Zuñiga & Kittilä's 'diathetical operation', e.g. 'causativisation') and the derived alternant (Zuñiga & Kittilä's 'diathesis', e.g. 'causative') will be referred to here simply as a ~~diathesis~~, from Greek *διάθεσις* 'placement in order, (re)arrangement'.

A side-effect of this approach is that 'active' is not a diathesis, but simply the unmarked counterpart of a diathetical operation. Even stronger, I will refrain from using the term 'active' because it immediately conjures up 'passive' as its antithesis. This opposition is too much of an oversimplification as 'passive' is just one of the hundreds of possible diatheses. Also, the 'active' does not necessarily describes an action, so content-wise this term is also ill-fitting. As an alternative, I will use the term ~~basic clause~~ as the unmarked base of comparison for all clause alternations. A basic clause is a clause with a single (finite) verb from, either in the German *Präsens* or *Präteritum* tense.^[Strictly speaking, a basic clause can also be a clause with a single finite verb form in the *Konjunktiv I* or *Konjunktiv II*. However, because these are rather rare nowadays I have hidden this option in this footnote.] All other verb forms, including the *Perfekt* and the other traditional German tense-aspect distinctions, are all ~~derived clauses~~, i.e. the result of some kind of clause alternations. A clause alternation without diathesis will be called ~~epithesis~~, from Greek *ἐπίθεσις* 'placement upon, imposition'. Epithesis is grammatical marking 'on top of' a basic clause.^[There appears to be a rare alternative usage to the term 'epithesis' in linguistics to indicate the addition of a sound to the end of the word, i.e. a special kind of epenthesis, see for example <http://www.websters1913.com/words/Epithesis>.] A summary of all major epithetical constructions will be presented in the next Chapter [-@sec:epithesis].

The actual linguistic marking of the diathesis (for example by verbal morphology or auxiliaries) is called 'grammatical voice' in Zuñiga & Kittilä [-@zuniga2019: 4]. In this book, each diathesis is defined as a combination of a (re-)mapping of roles and a specific kind of linguistic marking of the main predicate. So again, this extra terminological distinction is not necessary. The formal expression ('grammatical voice') is simply a definitional part of each diathesis here. The different kinds of grammatical voice in German are used in this book as a major organisational characteristic for the separation of the data chapters (see [@sec:intro-voice]).

The term 'transitivity' [@zuniga2019: 3; following @hopper1980] describes a (recurrent) connection between a diathetical operation and semantic effects on the meaning of the clause. For example, when an accusative argument is remapped onto a prepositional phrase, this often implies less involvement of the argument. The details of such semantic effects of each of the diatheses in this book is a fascinating topic, for which I unfortunately can only offer limited insights throughout. In practice, I assume that each diathesis as described here has some kind of semantic effect, but the details of these effect need much more detailed research that has to be provided by subsequent work.

Finally, I prefer to use the term 'diathesis' over the frequently attested term 'valency alternation', because there are many diatheses in which the valency does not change between the alternants. For example, in [@next]  both sentences have the same valency with a nominative, accusative and prepositional phrase. However, there is a clear diathesis, though arguably there is no change in (basic) valency. Strictly speaking, valency alternations are a subset of all diatheses.

## Valency {#sec:intro-valency}

### Utterance valency and lexical roles

Valency is traditionally interpreted as a fixed constructional characteristic of a lexical verb, e.g. the verb *geben* 'to give' is said to be ditransitive.^[I will consider predicative adjectives also as verbs, e.g *bewusst sein* 'to be aware', *einig sein* 'to agree' or *ähnlich sein* 'to resemble'. In German, predicative adjectives use the copula *sein*, so in many other grammatical analyses such predicates have a special status. In contrast, they will simply be treated as a single (though multiword) verb here.] A central thesis of this book is that this conception of valency is misguided. Individual verbs can (and normally will) be used in many different constructions with different valency (i.e. most verbs show some kind of diathesis). Consider for example the verb *wehen* 'to blow'. Such 'weather' verbs are often considered to have zero valency, which in German is characterised by an obligatory *es* pronoun [@next a]. However, the same verb can just as well be used as an intransitive [@next b,c], as a transitive with an accusative object [@next d], or even as a ditransitive with a dative and accusative object [@next e]. Note that the prepositional phrase in [@next c,d,e] cannot be left out, and its obligatory presence might be used to argue for argument-status of these prepositional phrases. The example in [@next e] then will be an example of the verb *wehen* with a valency of four.

::: ex
a. Heute weht es.
b. Gestern wehte kein Lüftchen.
c. Der Rosenduft weht ins Zimmer.
d. Der Sturm weht den Schnee von den Dächern.
e. Der Fahrtwind weht mir die Mütze vom Kopf.
:::

There is a recurrent tendency in the literature to try and reduce such variation to a single valency per verb (viz. its 'real' or 'underlying' valency), and various strategies are employed to arrive at such a prototypical valency [see e.g. @welke2011: Ch. 9 for a survey]. That will not be the approach taken here. Instead, valency is proposed to be a characteristic of a specific utterance, not of a specific verb. So, the examples in [@last] can simple be assigned an ~~utterance valency~~ from zero [@last a] to four [@last e] even though they all use the same lexeme *wehen* as their main verb. 

As a replacement of the traditional lexeme-specific notion of valency (e.g. *geben* is ditransitive), I propose to use the notion of lexeme-specific ~~lexical roles~~ (e.g. *geben* has lexical roles 'giver', 'givee', 'given object', etc.). Lexical roles are participants that are treated as an argument of utterance valency in at least one of the possible diatheses of a verb (see the next section for the complete definition of such arguments). Looking back at the examples in [@last e], the following lexical roles of *wehen* 'to blow' can be established:

i. ~~blower~~: the blowing air, *Fahrtwind* 'headwind'.
ii. ~~blowee~~: Object moved by the blowing air, *Mütze* 'cap'.
iii. ~~blowing direction~~: Direction of movement induced by the blowing air, *vom Kopf* 'off the head'.
iv. ~~blowing location possessor~~: Possessor of the locational object, in [@last e] the dative *mir* 'my'. This role is necessarily the possessor of the location *Kopf* 'head' where the blowing is taking place.

Additionally, it is of course possible to define a notion of ~~lexeme valency~~, but this has to be a much more complex construct. For example, lexeme valency can be defined as the collection of all attested utterance valencies for a specific lexeme. To be precise, this lexeme valency also has to include an indexation of the lexical roles across all arguments. This addition is important to distinguish between, for example, the lexical valency of *kochen* 'to cook' [@next] and *essen* 'to eat' [@nnext]. Both can occur with a transitive and intransitive utterance valency, but the lexical roles that can be used in the intransitive differ. Specifically, the patient-role 'eaten object' of *essen* cannot be used as nominative subject in the intransitive [@nnext c], which is different from *kochen* [@next c]. In effect, these verbs have a different lexeme valency.

::: ex
a. Der Chef kocht den Fond.
b. Der Chef kocht immer noch.
c. Der Fond kocht immer noch.
:::

::: ex
a. Der Chef isst den Fond.
b. Der Chef isst immer noch.
c. ^* Der Fond isst immer noch.
:::

### Arguments of utterance valency {#sec:intro-arguments-utterance-valency}

The lexical roles of a specific verb are defined as those participants that are treated as an argument in at least one of the possible utterance valencies of this verb. So, to identify lexical roles, a strict definition of the arguments of utterance valency is needed. The following kinds of arguments are identified. First, all case marked noun phrase constituents are arguments, with a few exceptions that will be discussed in [@sec:case-delimiting-arguments]. Basically, case marked arguments [@next a] can be questioned by question pronouns *wer* or *was*, including their case forms *wem*, *wen* and *wessen* [@next b,c]. Further, they can be pronominalized by personal pronouns [@next d] or indefinite pronouns *(irgend)jemand* or *(irgend)etwas* [@next e].

::: ex
a. Der Löwe sieht einen Vogel.
b. Wer sieht einen Vogel?
c. Was sieht der Löwe?
d. Er sieht ihn.
e. Jemand sieht etwas.
:::

Second, prepositional phrases [@next a] are arguments of an utterance when they can be replaced by a complement clause of the form *da(r)+preposition, dass…* [@next b]. All details of the difficult question when to treat such governed prepositional phrases as arguments are discussed in [@sec:prepositions-delimiting-governed-prepositional-phrases].

::: ex
a. Der Weltreisende wartet auf einen Zug.
b. Der Weltreisende wartet darauf, dass ein Zug kommt.
:::

Third, there exist obligatory prepositional phrases, though they are not very widespread in German and mostly designate a location. Some verbs always expect such a location-role, like *sich befinden* 'to be located somewhere' [@next a,b], see e.g. [@sec:prepositions-obligatory-local] and [-@sec:reflexive-obligatory-local], but more widespread are resultative diatheses that introduce an obligatory local role, like with *brechen* 'to break' [@next c,d], see e.g. [@sec:prepositions-partitive-free]. The example in [@next c] crucially shows that arguments should be determined as part of the clause structure, not the lexeme structure. It is perfectly possible to use the verb *brechen* without a prepositional phrase [@next e], but then there needs to be a different lexical role in the accusative.

::: ex
a. Der Stuhl befindet sich im Wohnzimmer
b. ^* Der Stuhl befindet sich.
c. Ich breche ein Loch in den Felsen.
d. ^* Ich breche ein Loch.
e. Ich breche den Felsen.
:::

Finally, all complement clauses are arguments [@next a,b]. Complement clauses can be questioned by *was* [@next c] and pronominalised by a definite pronoun *es* [@next d] or an indefinite pronoun *(irgend)etwas* [@next e]. Complement clauses are thus syntactically highly similar to case marked noun phrases. Caution should be taken when interpreting pronominalised examples like [@next d,e], because it is not immediately obvious whether the pronouns are replacing a case-marked noun phrase or a complement clause. For example, with the verb *hoffen* [@next e] it is not possible to replace the pronoun *es* with a noun phrase, though a governed prepositional phrase with *auf* is possible [@next f].

::: ex
a. Er hofft, dass er rechtzeitig kommt.
b. Er hofft rechtzeitig zu kommen.
c. Was hofft er?
d. Er hofft es.
e. ^* Er hofft eine gute Note.
f. Er hofft auf eine gute Note.
:::

### *es* Arguments {#sec:intro-es}

A further kind of utterance-valency argument can be instantiated by *es*, the 3rd person nominative/accusative pronoun in the neuter gender. There are various uses of this pronoun that have to be distinguished. The most obvious use the pronouns *es* is for anaphoric reference (~~phoric~~ *es*). The next two uses do not have argument-status (viz. ~~correlative~~ and ~~position-simulating~~ *es*). Most interestingly in the current context, the fourth usage of *es* does not have anaphoric reference, but will still be counted as an argument (viz. ~~valency-simulating~~ *es*). 

First, *es* can be used for anaphoric reference to neuter nouns, typically with gender agreement as shown in [@next]. There are many variants of such ~~phoric~~ usage, extensively discussed by Czicza [-@czicza2014: Ch. 2]. 

::: ex
Das Mädchen weint. \
Ich tröste es.
:::

Second, another kind of referential *es* occurs with some non-finite complement clauses. By definition, a complement clause replaces an argument [@next a], but in some cases a pronoun *es* remains in place of the original argument, side by side with the complement clause [@next b]. This is known as a ~~correlative~~ *es* [@czicza2014: 79ff.].

::: ex
a. Ich vergesse [meine Aufgaben]. Ich vergesse [schnell zu laufen].
b. Ich hasse [meine Aufgaben]. Ich hasse es [schnell zu laufen].
:::

Third, the pronoun *es* is also used to fill the first sentence position in front of the finite verb ('Vorfeld' in German grammatical terminology), because there is a strong regularity in German that this position cannot be left empty (except in imperatives and in yes/no questions). Word order is rather flexible in German, and it is often possible to have no lexical content in the Vorfeld. In such sentences, the pronoun *es* has to be used to fill the Vorfeld, as shown in [@next b]. This is known as a ~~position-simulating~~ *es* [@czicza2014: 115].

::: ex
a. Ein Mädchen weint. 
b. Es weint ein Mädchen.
:::

Finally, there are also constructions that obligatorily include the pronoun *es* in the sentence as part of the valency of the utterance. The main reason for such an *es* is that there is a strong regularity in German that a nominative subject has to be present in each sentence (with very few exceptions, see below). Note that 'subject' is defined here for German as the nominative noun phrase that shows agreement with the finite verb. When there is no subject available, then the pronoun *es* is used to fill this gap. This is known as a ~~valency-simulating~~ *es* [@czicza2014: 115]. In the analysis of diatheses in this book, such valency-simulating *es* is not alway explicitly noted. Any clause without an nominative argument induces a valency-simulating *es* (with very few exceptions, as noted below).

In constructions with a valency-simulating *es*, as exemplified in [@next a,b], the pronoun *es* can occur in the Vorfeld [@next a], seemingly parallel to the position-simulating usage [@last a]. However, when another constituent is placed in the Vorfeld, this obligatory *es* in [@next a] cannot be removed, but has to occur elsewhere in the sentence, typically immediately after the finite verb [@next b]. 

::: ex
a. Es stinkt hier sehr.
b. Hier stinkt es sehr.
:::

In a very limited set of constructions, a valency-simulating *es* is left out, resulting in sentences without any formal nominative subject [@next]. Most of these cases are historical idiosyncrasies, except for the impersonal passive [@next d], see [@sec:participles-werden-impersonal-passive].

::: ex
a. Heute ist mir kalt.
b. Dem Arzt graut vor Blut.
c. Mir liegt viel an deiner Anwesenheit.
d. Jetzt wird geschlafen!
:::

There are also a few rare cases in which there is a valency-simulating *es* in what appears to be an accusative case [@next].

::: ex
a. Ich habe es auf ihn abgesehen. (see [@sec:prepositions-nominative-es-preposition])
b. Wir haben es gut. (see [@sec:adverbial-accusative-es])
:::

### Adjuncts

Adjuncts, the counterparts of arguments, are phrases that are not specifically induced by the main verb of a clause. Typically, such adjuncts are adverbial prepositional phrases, see [@sec:prepositions-definition-non-governed]. Just like with arguments, adjunct status should not be linked to a lexical verb itself, but to the clause construction in which it is used. For example, the verb *tanzen* 'to dance' is typically considered to be an intransitive verb with optional (adjunct) locational prepositional phrases [@next a,b]. However, there is a crucial difference between the two locations in these two examples, see [@sec:prepositions-manner-of-movement]. The static location *im Saal* 'in the hall' [@next a] remains optional in the perfect (with auxiliary *haben*), see [@next c,d], while the dynamic location *in den Saal* 'into the hall' becomes obligatory in the perfect (with auxiliary *sein*), see [@next e,f]. So, the obligatory location in [@next e] is an utterance argument (and as a consequence, the role of 'path' is a lexical role of such verbs of movement like *tanzen*).

::: ex
a. Ich tanze (im Saal).
b. Ich tanze (durch den Saal).
c. Ich habe im Saal getanzt.
d. Ich habe getanzt.
e. Ich bin durch den Saal getanzt.
f. ^* Ich bin getanzt.
:::

Adjuncts are, by definition, optionally present, so there is a natural connection to zero expression. A central problem here is whether there is a crucial distinction between constructions in which a participant is obligatorily absent (i.e. impossible to express) vs. optionally absent (i.e. possibly not expressed). In most diatheses that involve absence, the whole point is that there is an alternation between absence and presence of a lexical role (e.g. in all drop and addition diatheses). The problematic cases are differences like passive vs. anticausative, which by definition are distinguished by possibility vs. impossibility for the agent to be expressed. This difference is highly volatile (i.e. it often differs from lexeme to lexeme whether it is possible or just dispreferred for an agent to be expressed).

## Voice {#sec:intro-voice}

The formal linguistic marking of a diathesis, for example by verbal morphology or auxiliaries, is called ~~grammatical voice~~ [following @zuniga2019: 4]. The different kinds of grammatical voice in German are the basic organisational framework of this book. Each chapter discusses a specific kind of grammatical voice, listing all diatheses using that marking. The nine main chapters can be grouped into four kinds of grammatical voices:

- zero-marked 'covert' diatheses (Chapters [-@sec:case; -@sec:prepositions])
- diatheses marked by reflexive pronouns (Chapter [-@sec:reflexive])
- diatheses marked by preverbs or adverbials (Chapters [-@sec:preverbs; -@sec:adverbial])
- diatheses marked by light-verb constructions (Chapters [-@sec:participle; -@sec:infinitive; -@sec:zuinfinitive; -@sec:zuminfinitive])

The first two chapters deal with diatheses that are not overtly marked as such, i.e. they deal with 'covert' diatheses. Because there is no marking on either of the two alternants, it is often difficult to discern a direction in such equipollent alternations. In Chapter [-@sec:case] I will discuss diatheses that only differ in the marking of case, for example unmarked anticausatives like [@next]. Chapter [-@sec:prepositions] deals with unmarked diatheses in which at least on of the alternants is a prepositional phrase, for example unmarked antipassive like [@nnext].

::: ex
a. Er verbrennt den Tisch.
b. Der Tisch verbrennt.
:::

::: ex
a. Ich schlürfe meinen Tee.
b. Ich schlürfe an meinem Tee.
:::

The contribution of reflexive pronouns for the marking of diathesis is discussed in Chapter [-@sec:reflexive]. A central claim in this chapter is that 'self inflicting' reflexive reference [@next] does not count as diathesis in German. In contrast, there are various constructions in German that use reflexive pronouns without such 'self inflicting' reflexive reference, like the antipassive in [@nnext]. In such diatheses the presence of a reflexive pronoun is the actual marking of the diathesis, it is not signalling that subject and object are the same participant. An important generalisation about diatheses with reflexive pronouns is that they are always demotions.

::: ex
a. Ich wasche das Auto.
b. Ich wasche mich.
:::

::: ex
a. Ich fürchte den Tod.
b. Ich fürchte mich vor den Tod.
:::

In Chapter [-@sec:preverbs] I will turn to preverbs, i.e. verbal prefixes that in German grammar are known as *Verbpräfixe* and *Verbpartikeln*. Grammatically, these are different kinds of prefixes, but from the perspective of diathesis they appear to function rather similar. The most widespread diathesis marked by such preverbs is an applicative, like with *be-* in [@next]. Because of the bound morphological structure, these diatheses show a strong tendency to grammaticalise into a large variety of different kinds of diatheses. A central generalisation of the diatheses discussed in this chapter is that the resulting sentence structures after diathesis are mostly transitive (esp. nominative+accusative).

::: ex
a. Ich steige auf den Berg.
b. Ich besteige den Berg.
:::

Closely related to preverbs are resultative adverbials that induce diathesis, like the applicative with *leer* in [@next]. There exist also diatheses induced by depictive adverbials, like the reflexive anticausative with *gut* in [@nnext]. Although these two kinds of adverbials, resultative vs. depictive, occur in rather different kinds of diathesis, for convenience both phenomena are combined into a single chapter on adverbially marked diatheses in Chapter [-@sec:adverbial].

::: ex
a. Ich habe in dem Teich gefischt.
b. Ich habe den Teich leergefischt.
:::

::: ex
a. Ich fahre den Lastwagen.
b. Der Lastwagen fährt sich gut.
:::

A large number of diatheses use light verbs in combination with a non-finite form of the lexical verb. A somewhat surprising insight is that light-verb diatheses always involve a role-change of the nominative subject. I distinguish four different kinds of light verb constructions, to be discussed in four different chapters. Chapter [-@sec:participle] discusses light verb construction with participles, like the infamous *werden+Partizip* passive [@next].

::: ex
a. Ich habe einen Brief geschrieben.
b. Der Brief wurde geschrieben.
:::

The next three chapters describe different combinations of light verbs with lexical verbs in the infinitive. Chapter [-@sec:infinitive] discusses light verbs with straight infinitives, like the *lassen+Infinitiv* causative [@next]. 

::: ex
a. Ich wasche meine Kleider.
b. Sie lässt mich meine Kleider waschen.
:::

Chapter [-@sec:zuinfinitive] investigates light verbs with *zu* plus an infinitive, like the *sein+zu‑Infinitiv* passive [@next]. The combination of *zu* with an infinitive is arguably completely grammaticalised and is simply considered here as yet another non-finite verb form of German, alongside *Partizip* and *Infinitiv*. I propose to call it the *zu-Infinitiv*.

::: ex
a. Ich führe einen Hund an der Leine.
b. Ein Hund ist an der Leine zu führen.
:::

Finally, Chapter [-@sec:zuminfinitive] looks at the combinations of prepositions, article and an infinitive, like the *halten+am‑Infinitiv* causative [@nnext]. In such constructions, the preposition and article are obligatorily fused (*an*+*dem*>*am*) and this fused combination cannot be separated from the infinitive. Such completely grammaticalised constructions appear to be rather recent in German and are often considered substandard. Only a few of such combinations pass all the tests for complete grammaticalisation. When all tests apply, then I consider the combination of preposition+article+infinitive to be yet another non-finite verb form of German, alongside *Partizip*, *Infinitiv* and *zu-Infinitiv*. I propose to call it the *Präpositionsinfinitiv*.

::: ex
a. Das Feuer brennt.
b. Der Wind hält das Feuer am Brennen.

## Diathetical operations {#sec:intro-diathetical-operations}

### Abbreviations used

A diathetical operation is a change that happens to the marking of the participants in a diathesis. One of the central definitional properties of a diathesis is that the coding of at least one of the participants has to change, for example a participant erstwhile coded with an accusative turns into a prepositional phrase. Because the role of the participant remains the same (again, by definition), such a change amounts to the mapping of a role onto a different grammatical form. I will call this process ~~role-remapping~~.

In the analysis of diathetical operations in this book I will use the following abbreviations, as summarised in [@fig:abbreviations]. First, ~~grammatical expressions~~, i.e. actual grammatical forms as identified in traditional German grammar, are abbreviated with single letters, shown at the right side of the figure. For case-marked noun phrases I will use the easily recognisable capital letters 'NADG' for nominative, accusative, dative and genitive respectively. As argued earlier (see [@sec:intro-arguments-utterance-valency]) there are also prepositional phrases that express lexically-determined roles. These will also be abbreviated with capital letters: 'L' for obligatory locations and 'P' for governed prepositional phrases.

![Abbreviations used to describe role-remapping](figures/abbreviations){#fig:abbreviations}

Lower-cased letters are used for non-argument participants in the clause: 'p' for non-governed prepositional phrases and 'g' for adnominal genitives. Adnominal genitives become relevant because in some diatheses a newly introduced participant is inherently the possessor of another participant (see [@par:possraising]). Absence of a specific role will be indicated by a '–' dash. Lower-cased 'a' and 'd' are only used in [@sec:reflexive-no-diathesis] to indicate accusative and dative reflexive pronouns in referential usage. As described in much detail in that chapter, it is important to distinguish between reflexive pronouns in German that refer to a lexical role (i.e. 'referential' or 'real' reflexive constructions) and reflexive pronouns that mark a diathesis without referring to a separate role themselves. Those latter reflexive pronouns, that are not marking any role, are not abbreviated by lowercased 'a' or 'd'.

Besides single-letter abbreviations I will also use capitalised three-letter abbreviations for a more abstract level of analysis. As summarised at the left side of [@fig:abbreviations], the grammatical expressions are grouped into sets of ~~grammatical macroroles~~, mostly along familiar lines. However, it is crucial to realise that these macroroles are defined here as a superset of specifically German grammatical expressions. There is no abstract metalinguistic definition assumed. The current grouping is not necessarily the best or most optimal grouping, but this grouping has emerged to be useful to organise the large diversity of diatheses in this book. 

The notion ~~subject (SBJ)~~ is used for governed nominative phrases that show agreement with the finite verb.^[There are various other nominatively-marked phrases in German grammar which are not included under this heading, e.g. the nominative in nominal or equational predication like *der Täter* in *Er ist der Täter*.] The other case-marked governed phrases are combined as ~~cased objects (OBJ)~~. The cased objects together with the ~~prepositional objects (PBJ)~~ form a superclass of objects. Non-governed phrases are separated in ~~overtly expressed adjuncts (ADJ)~~ and unexpressed roles ~~zero (Ø)~~. Although I will use this five-way distinction throughout this book ~~(SBJ, OBJ, PBJ, ADJ, Ø)~~, the five steps are not equidistant. The macroroles ~~OBJ~~ and ~~PBJ~~ are rather closely related, and likewise are ~~ADJ~~ and ~~Ø~~ intimately linked. Collapsing these pairs results in the traditional subject-object-adjunct distinction.

{#par:corecase} There are some indications that the group of cased objects ~~(OBJ)~~ might be fruitfully separated into ~~core~~ (accusative) and ~~non-core~~ (dative/genitive). This would simplify the analysis of, for example, case change in object chains ([@sec:intro-object-chains]), the antipassive hierarchy ([@sec:prepositions-demotion-of-object]) and the case-marking of the reflexive pronoun ([@sec:reflexive-deponent]). However, in the majority of diatheses all three cases seem to behave as a uniform group, so I did not consistently pursue this separation.

It is imperative to realise that the macroroles are defined in a language-specific way for German grammar as groupings of language-specific German expressions (e.g. ~~ADJ~~ is defined as being either a non-governed prepositional phrase or an adnominal genitive). The names that are used (e.g. 'object' or 'adjunct') deliberately conjure up general cross-linguistic associations, but it remains to be seen whether similar definitions as used here are also useful for other languages. I will refrain from any cross-linguistic speculation in this context here.

### Remapping of roles {#sec:intro-remapping}

Using the abbreviations as summarised in [@fig:abbreviations] I will organise and categorise the role-remapping of all diatheses in various levels of abstraction. These different categorisations inform the practical organisation of each chapter.

~~Level 1: diathesis~~. Each diathesis is summarised in its own sub-subsection. The establishment of an individual diathesis is not always obvious, and each diathesis in this book is already an conscious categorisation (which could be wrong). It has actually been a voyage of discovery in the preparation of this book to decide when to consider a set of examples to be a single diathesis. Very often erstwhile single diatheses turned out to be better analysed by a split into various different diatheses. Although I am rather confident in the quality of the current decisions, I expect that further refinements are necessary in the future.

~~Level 2: remapping pattern~~. The role-remapping of each diathesis is analysed using the single-letter abbreviations (NADGPLpgad–) from [@fig:abbreviations]. A remapping is specified as an ordered listing of grammatical expressions for roles, both before and after the diathesis. For example, ~~[NA | –N]~~ is a diathesis that involves two roles that are marked 'NA' before the diathesis and '–N' after the diathesis. Because there are many diatheses with this same pattern, this characterisation is already an (implicit) classification.

~~Level 3: local group~~. Groups of diatheses with similar semantics within each chapter are grouped together as a local group. These groups are rather ad-hoc and mainly represent a convenience-summary to streamline the presentation. Local groups are unnumbered subsections, indicated graphically with dashes around the name of the local group.

~~Level 4: macrorole pattern~~. The remapping of each local group is structurally analysed in terms of the three-letter macroroles ~~(SBJ, OBJ, PBJ, ADJ, Ø)~~ from [@fig:abbreviations]. For example, the remapping from above ~~[NA | –N]~~ includes both a change from N to zero (i.e. ~~SBJ › Ø~~) and a change from A to N (i.e. ~~OBJ › SBJ~~). These two macrorole changes can be combined into a single macrorole patter ~~[OBJ › SBJ › Ø]~~.

~~Level 5: promotion/demotion~~. On the most abstract level, all diatheses are separated into chapter-subsections of either demotion or promotion (with only very few diatheses being symmetrical exchanges). Basically, each remapping is evaluated on the macrorole hierarchy [@next] with role-remapping upwards being promotion and role-remapping downward being demotion. Note that there is a crucial additional criterion necessary, because the majority of diatheses consist of chains of two coinciding remappings (see [@sec:intro-chaining] on the notion of 'chains'). In such remappings, the largest jump on the macrorole hierarchy defines a diathesis as being demotion or promotion. When both jumps are equally large, then the diathesis is ~~symmetrical~~.

::: {#ex:macrorolehierarchy .ex}
Macrorole Hierarchy

~~SBJ » OBJ » PBJ » ADJ » Ø~~
:::

For example, the diathesis in [@next] will be analysed as a ~~remapping pattern [NA | –N]~~, see [@sec:reflexive-anticausative]. This should be read as follows: there is an alternation between a clause with 'NA' arguments (nominative, accusative) and a clause with only 'N' marking (nominative). The relative order of these letters is crucial, as the order of the roles remains fixed in this notation, e.g. the second letter on the left 'A' (accusative) corresponds to the second letter on the right 'N' (nominative). The '–' dash on the right indicates that the corresponding 'N' on the left is not expressed. Note that the actual linear arrangement of the letters is flexible, as long as both sides of the alternation remain in the same order, i.e. ~~[AN | N–]~~ would be the same remapping pattern as ~~[NA | –N]~~. The pattern ~~[NA | –N]~~ is an implicit categorisation, because there are many other diatheses that have exactly the same pattern (see e.g. [@sec:case-haben-anticausative; @sec:adverbial-reflexive-transitive-anticausative; @sec:participles-sein-zustandspassiv]).

::: ex
a. Ich schließe die Tür.
b. Die Tür schließt sich. 
:::

Although there is a reflexive pronoun in [@last b], this pronoun is not included with a lower-cased 'a' in the remapping pattern ~~[NA | –N]~~, because this reflexive pronoun does not refer to a separate role. The verb *schließen* 'to close' implies at least two different roles, the 'closer' and the 'closed object', expressed as nominative and accusative in [@last a], respectively. In [@last b] only the role of 'closed object' is expressed as nominative. The reflexive pronoun does not refer to any other role.

I interpret the reflexive pronoun in [@last] as a marker of the diathesis itself (see Chapter [-@sec:reflexive] for an extensive discussion), so there is an overt direction in the markedness from [@last a] to [@last b]. The vertical bar ' | ' in the middle of the remapping pattern ~~[NA | –N]~~ implies this direction in markedness from left to right, i.e. left side describes the unmarked alternant and the right side the marked alternant. Reordering the remapping pattern would result in a completely reversed diathesis ~~[–N | NA]~~.

The diathesis in [@last] is one of various examples of a ~~local group~~ called 'reflexive antipassive'. Other diatheses in this group include examples like [@next] with an additional governed preposition, analysed with the remapping pattern ~~[NAP | –NP]~~, see [@sec:reflexive-anticausative-governed-preposition]. All diatheses in this local group have the same ~~macrorole pattern~~, namely ~~[OBJ › SBJ › Ø]~~, i.e a cased object is turned into nominative subject, which is turned into zero (i.e. unexpressed).

This diathesis is a combination of two different remappings ~~[OBJ › SBJ]~~ and ~~[SBJ › Ø]~~, with the first being a promotion on the macrorole hierarchy and the second a demotion. However, because the second remapping ~~[SBJ › Ø]~~ is a larger jump on the hierarchy, the complete combination is categorised as a ~~demotion~~.

::: ex
a. Das Lied erinnert den Mann an den Krieg.
b. Der Mann erinnert sich an den Krieg.
:::

So, in summary, the role-remapping in the diathesis [@last] is categorised as:

1. ~~Diathesis~~: reflexive antipassive+governed preposition
2. ~~Remapping Pattern~~: ~~[NAP | –NP]~~
3. ~~Local Group~~: reflexive antipassive
4. ~~Macrorole Pattern~~: ~~[OBJ › SBJ › Ø]~~
5. ~~Promotion/Demotion~~: demotion

## Stacking {#sec:intro-stacking}

### Combining diatheses

Different diatheses can be applied one after the other, forming ~~stacks~~ of diatheses. The term 'stacking' is introduced here explicitly in opposition to 'subordinating'. Subordination leads to non-coherent multi-clause constructions, while stacks always remain coherent and thus monoclausal.

Stacked diatheses can lead to convoluted role-remappings. A beautiful example of such stacking of diatheses is given by Dixon [-@dixon2014: 252] for the Amazonian language Paumarí. Here, the root *noki-* 'to see' is transparently related to the meaning 'to show' through a series of derivational diatheses, viz. *noki-* 'to see', *noki-a-* 'to be visible', *na-noki-a-* 'to become visible', and finally *na-noki-a-hi-* 'to make become visible' i.e. 'to show'. 

German does not have that many morphologically bound mechanisms for diathesis, though there are incidental examples that come close. For example, the verb *liegen* 'to lie' changes with ablaut to *legen* 'to lay' (see [@sec:case-umlaut-causative]), which in turn can take a preverb to form *be-legen* 'to cover' (see [@sec:preverb-applicative-antipassive]). However, when the perspective is broadened beyond bound morphology and all different kinds of German diatheses are considered, then it turns out that stacking of diatheses is extremely widespread.

In many cases, the different steps in a stack can be easily disentangled by carefully observing the formal marking of the diathesis. For example, the construction in [@next c] includes both a preverb *be-* and a reflexive pronoun *sich* and it turns out that these are applied in turn to make a stack of two diatheses. Starting with the verb *antworten* 'to answer' with a governed preposition *auf* [@next a], the applicative preverb *be-* changes the prepositional phrase to an accusative [@next b], see [@sec:preverb-applicative]. Subsequently, the reflexive anticausative turns the accusative into a nominative and drops the nominative agent [@next c], see [@sec:reflexive-anticausative].

::: ex
a. Der Lehrer antwortet auf deine Frage.
b. Der Lehrer beantwortet deine Frage.
c. Deine Frage beantwortet sich von selbst.
:::

Diatheses are applied one after the other, i.e. the order of the diatheses in a stack is of crucial importance in most cases (unordered stacks exist, but are unusual, see [@sec:intro-disjunct-diatheses]). Basically, a stack is just a list of clause alternations applied one after the other. Semantically this means that each subsequent clause alternation has scope over the previous one. This can for example be written down using a symbol like +> to indicate the additive (+) and sequential (>) nature of the combination. The stack above can then be analysed as: [@last c] = [@last a] +> *be-* applicative +> reflexive anticausative. This notation leads to concise analyses, as for example shown in [@next] for the difference between [@next a] and [@next b]. 

::: ex
a. Der Lehrer hat die Aufgabe lösen wollen. \
   = Der Lehrer löst die Aufgabe \
   +> *wollen* modal (see [@sec:infinitive-modals]) \
   +> *haben* perfect (see [@sec:participles-haben-perfect])
b. Der Lehrer will die Aufgabe gelöst haben. \
   = Irgendjemand löst die Aufgabe für den Lehrer. \
   +> benefactive dative (see [@sec:prepositions-benefactive-dative]) \
   +> *haben* dative passive (see [@sec:participles-haben-passive]) \
   +> *wollen* modal (see [@sec:infinitive-modals])
:::

With unmarked ('covert') diatheses such stacks can sometimes be tricky to tease apart. As an example, consider the arguably somewhat artificially constructed example in [@next] using the verb *schneiden* 'to cut'. It starts off in [@next a] as a basic transitive construction with a nominative and accusative argument. Yet, after various twists and turns it ends up on [@next f] with a nominative, an accusatives, a dative and an obligatory locational prepositional phrase, while the original agent *Arzt* is not even expressed.

::: ex
a. Der Arzt schneidet den Nagel des Patienten.
b. Der Arzt schneidet in den Nagel des Patienten.
c. Der Arzt schneidet dem Patienten in den Nagel.
d. Der Arzt schneidet dem Patienten einen Schlitz in den Nagel.
e. Der Arzt schneidet dem Patienten einen Schlitz in den Nagel mit dem Fräser.
f. Der Fräser schneidet dem Patienten einen Schlitz in den Nagel.
:::

Teasing this stack apart, there are five different diatheses, concurrently showing that the verb *schneiden* has at least five different lexeme-specific roles. As defined in [@sec:intro-lexical-roles], each role that appears as a case-marked constituent in at least one diathesis is a lexeme-specific role, and all of the following participants are case-marked in the stack of diatheses [@last]:

- the cutter *Arzt* 'physician'
- the cut object *Nagel* 'nail'
- the possessor of the cut object *Patient* 'patient'
- the result of the cutting *Schlitz* 'groove, slit'
- the instrument doing the cutting *Fräser* 'milling cutter'

The five diatheses (and the corresponding role-remappings) are the following:

- [@last b], *in* antipassive: changing the cut object *Nagel* from accusative to prepositional object, see [@sec:prepositions-in-antipassive].
- [@last c], possessor raising: changing the possessor of the cut object *Patient* from adnominal genitive into dative, see [@sec:prepositions-possessor-of-location-to-dative-experiencer].
- [@last d], resultative: adding a new accusative object *Schlitz* as the result of the cutting, see [@sec:prepositions-partitive-free].
- [@last e], adjunct addition: adding an optional instrument *Fräser*, see [@sec:prepositions-comitative-intrumental].
- [@last f], instrument anticausative: turning the instrument *Fräser* from prepositional phrase to nominative, see [@sec:prepositions-transitive-conciliative].

### Fixed stacks

There are a few examples of diatheses that look like stacks of two diatheses, but on closer inspection it turns out that the intermediate construction does not exist. A few major examples of such ~~fixed stacks~~ are exemplified below.

There is an infamous anticausative diathesis that needs a reflexive pronoun, which is attested for a large, but restricted group of verbs like *schließen* 'to close' [@next a,b], see [@sec:reflexive-anticausative]. A completely different group of verbs also has an anticausative diathesis with a reflexive pronoun, but only with an additional evaluative adverbial. This is for example attested with *verkaufen* 'to sell' [@next c,d], see [@sec:adverbial-reflexive-transitive-anticausative]. In this case, the diathesis is marked by both the reflexive pronoun and the presence of an adverbial, and neither is possible without the other. Such a combination of two obligatorily co-occurring formal marking strategies is called a ~~fixed stack~~.

::: ex
a. Ich schließe die Tür.
b. Die Tür schließt sich.
c. Ich verkaufe das Buch.
d. Das Buch verkauft sich gut.
:::

Various diatheses between a bare verb, like *fassen* 'to grasp' [@next a], and a preverb-alternant, like *befassen* 'to be concerned with' [@next b], additionally need a reflexive pronoun, see [@sec:preverb-reflexive-antipassive]. So here we have a fixed stack of a reflexive pronoun and a preverb together that mark the diathesis.

::: ex
a. Ich fasse einen Entschluss. 
b. Ich befasse mich mit dem Entschluss.
:::

Also some light verb alternations show fixed stacks. For example, there is a very widespread causative diathesis using the light verb *lassen* with an infinitive [@next b], see [@sec:infinitive-lassen-causative]. Additionally, the combination of *lassen+Infinitiv* and a reflexive pronoun leads to an anticausative alternation [@next c], which does not make sense as being derived from the causative [@next b]. It seems better to consider the combination of *lassen+Infinitiv+Reflexiv* as a fixed stack, see [@sec:infinitive-lassen-reflexive-anticausative].

::: ex
a. Der Schüler löst die Aufgabe.
b. Der Lehrer lässt den Schüler die Aufgabe lösen.
c. Diese Aufgabe lässt sich lösen.
:::

## Chaining {#sec:intro-chaining}

### Isolated diatheses

Many diatheses just remap a single role. Such sole diatheses are called ~~isolated diatheses~~ here. However, there are also many diatheses in which more than one role is remapped. I distinguish the following kinds of role-remappings, of which only the first two are frequently attested.

- ~~Isolated Diathesis~~: Only one role changes its formal marking.
- ~~Chained Diathesis~~: Two roles change their formal marking, forming a chain in which one role changes its form from X to Y, while the other role changes its form from Y to Z. This results in a chain ~~[X › Y › Z]~~.
- ~~Multi-chained Diathesis~~: More than two roles change their formal marking, forming a longer chain of connected changes.
- ~~Disjunct Diathesis~~: Two (or more) roles change their formal marking, with no overlap between marking.

### Chained diatheses

When two roles are remapped by a single diathesis it is surprisingly frequent for them to be chained. In a ~~chained diathesis~~ the resulting form of one remapping is the start of the second. This can be conceptualised as a 'push' chain in which one remapping induces another. A reason for the prevalence of such chains might be that German grammar strongly disprefers multiple constituents of the same kind (e.g. two accusatives) in the same clause.

Chained diatheses typically occur when the nominative subject is involved in the diathesis. There can only be a single nominative subject in a German clause, and it is highly unusual to have a sentence without a nominative subject. This implies that any diathesis involving the nominative subject typically includes two remappings, namely one from something else to nominative and a second remapping of the erstwhile nominative to something else.

A prototypical example of a chained diathesis involving the nominative subject is the *werden* passive [@next]. Here, the erstwhile accusative *Kuchen* 'cake' is turned into a nominative, while the erstwhile nominative *Lehrling* 'apprentice' is removed (or optionally retained as a *von* prepositional phrase). So, we have a chain consisting of the role-remappings ~~[OBJ › SBJ]~~ and ~~[SBJ › ADJ]~~.

::: ex
~~[OBJ › SBJ › ADJ]~~

a. Der Lehrling backt den Kuchen.
b. Der Kuchen wird gebacken (von dem Lehrling).
:::

Diatheses without involvement of the nominative subject are more flexible, in that both isolated and chained diatheses are common. A typical example of a chained diathesis is an object exchange induced by the preverb *be-* [@next]. In this example, a prepositional phrase *für ihre Freundin* 'for her friend' is remapped to an accusative ~~[ADJ › OBJ]~~ while the erstwhile accusative *Essen* 'food' is turned into a prepositional phrase ~~[OBJ › ADJ]~~.

::: ex
~~[ADJ › OBJ › ADJ]~~

a. Sie kocht kubanisches Essen für ihre Freundin.
b. Sie bekocht ihre Freundin mit kubanischem Essen.
:::

Among chained diatheses there is a group of frequently recurring remapping patterns. Because of their frequency, it is highly useful to give them specific names. Such names are widespread in the literature, e.g. anticausative for ~~[OBJ › SBJ › Ø]~~ or passive for ~~[OBJ › SBJ › ADJ]~~. A survey of the various names used in this book will be pursued in [@sec:intro-naming].

### Multi-chained diatheses

~~multi-chained diatheses~~ consist of combinations of more than two role-remappings that occur in a sequence. This occurs frequently as the result of a stack of multiple diatheses, but only very rarely in a single diathesis. As an example arising from a stack of multiple diatheses consider taking a verb like *lesen* 'to read' [@next a] and applying a stack of two diatheses [@next b,c]. This leads to a chain of three role-remappings. First, the preverb diathesis with *vor-* [@next b] leads to the addition of a dative argument *dem Jungen*, i.e. a role-remapping ~~[Ø › OBJ]~~, see [@sec:preverb-dative-addition-accusative]. On top of that, the *bekommen* dative passive [@next c] promotes this dative to subject and removes the original subject, i.e. a role-remapping ~~[OBJ › SBJ › Ø]~~, see [@sec:participles-bekommen-passive]. Combined, these two diatheses lead to a role-remapping ~~[Ø › OBJ › SBJ › Ø]~~.

::: ex
~~[Ø › OBJ › SBJ › Ø]~~

a. Der Vater hat ein Buch gelesen.
b. Der Vater hat dem Jungen ein Buch vorgelesen.
c. Der Junge bekommt ein Buch vorgelesen.
:::

Such multi-chained diatheses resulting from diathesis-stacking are widespread. However, I know of only two diatheses with a multi-chain that cannot be decomposed into a stack of separate diatheses. Both these 'fixed' multi-chain diatheses appear to occur with just a few idiosyncratic verbs, so this phenomenon really seems to be dispreferred in German.

First, the preverb diathesis from *erben* 'to inherit' to *enterben* 'to disinherit' [@next], see [@sec:preverb-inverted-passive-accusative-loss], contains three linked role-remappings for (i) the originator of the inheritance *Vater* 'father' ~~[ADJ › SBJ]~~, (ii) the receiver of the inheritance *Junge* 'boy' ~~[SBJ › OBJ]~~ and (iii) the inheritance *Schreibtisch* 'desk' ~~[OBJ › Ø]~~.

::: ex
~~[ADJ › SBJ › OBJ › Ø]~~

a. Der Junge erbt den Schreibtisch von seinem Vater.
b. Sein Vater enterbt den Jungen.
:::

Second, the verb *schmecken* 'to taste' [@next], see [@sec:prepositions-ingredient-anticausative], allows for two different constructions with three linked role-remappings for (i) the tasted substance *Pfefferminze* 'peppermint' ~~[OBJ › ADJ]~~, (ii) the tasted dish *Suppe* 'soup' ~~[ADJ › SBJ]~~ and (iii) the taster *Koch* 'cook' ~~[SBJ › Ø]~~.

::: ex
~~[OBJ › ADJ › SBJ › Ø]~~

a. Der Koch schmeckt die Pfefferminze in der Suppe.
b. Die Suppe schmeckt nach Pfefferminze
:::

### Disjunct diatheses {#sec:intro-disjunct-diatheses}

~~disjunct diatheses~~ consist of a combination of multiple role-remappings that are not linked to each other. Just as with the multi-chained diatheses from the previous section, disjunct diatheses regularly occur as the result of stacking of diatheses. In contrast, they are very rare in individual diatheses.

When multiple diatheses are stacked, i.e. whey they are applied sequentially on top of each other, they are sometimes structurally independent (and thus unordered). For example, the verb *waschen* 'to wash' [@next a] can be used in a resultative construction [@next b] in which the role of washee *Hemd* 'shirt' is turned from an accusative into a location ~~[OBJ › PBJ]~~ and a new accusative object is introduced for the role of the result *Fleck* 'stain' ~~[Ø › OBJ]~~, see [@sec:prepositions-partitive-free]. Independent of this chained diathesis, the possessor of the object *Nachbar* 'neighbour' can be raised to genitive [@next c], see [@sec:prepositions-possessor-of-location-to-dative-experiencer-accusative].

::: ex
~~[Ø › OBJ › PBJ + ADJ › OBJ]~~

a. Ich wasche das Hemd des Nachbarn.
b. Ich wasche den Fleck aus dem Hemd des Nachbarn.
c. Ich wasche dem Nachbarn den Fleck aus dem Hemd.
:::

There are only a few incidental examples of such disjunct diatheses without stacking. The following four examples all only occur with a very limited number of verbs. First, the verb *deuten* can be used both to mean 'interpret' [@next a] and 'forebode' [@next b] with a rather transparent connection between the two. However, the role-remappings are quite complex, see [@sec:prepositions-anticausative-preposition-addition].

::: ex
~~[Ø › PBJ + OBJ › SBJ › Ø]~~

a. Ich deute den Traum. 
b. Der Traum deutet auf nichts Gutes. 
:::

Second, some preverbs lead to disjunct diatheses, like with *schweigen* 'to remain silent' and *verschweigen* 'to conceal' [@next], see [@sec:preverb-double-applicative].

::: ex
~~[ADJ › OBJ + PBJ › OBJ]~~

a. Ich schweige zu dir über meinen Besuch.
b. Ich verschweige dir meinen Besuch.
:::

Further examples are resultatives for a few verbs of naming like *schimpfen* 'to scold' [@next], see [@sec:prepositions-naming-result]. The disjunct diathesis in [@nnext] is less clear, as it might be better analysed as a stack, see [@sec:prepositions-nominative-demotion-dative-addition].

::: ex
~~[Ø › OBJ + ADJ › OBJ]~~

a. Sie schimpft auf mich.
b. Sie schimpft mich einen Narren
:::

::: ex
~~[Ø › OBJ + SBJ › ADJ]~~

a. Der Sommer ist kalt.
b. Mir ist kalt im Sommer.
:::

The only somewhat more widespread disjunct diathesis is the resultative construction that can arise with some apparently intransitive verbs like *schwitzen* 'to sweat' [@next]. This diathesis introduces two roles at once: a result *Fleck* 'stain' and an obligatory location *Hemd* 'shirt', see [@sec:prepositions-intransitive-location-as-result].

::: ex
~~[Ø › OBJ + Ø › PBJ]~~

a. Ich schwitze.
b. Ich schwitze einen Fleck in mein Hemd.
:::

## Naming {#sec:intro-naming}

### Names for macrorole patterns

Throughout the introductory chapters, I have used various names for diatheses, like passive, antipassive, applicative or causative. These names have a long history in the typological grammatical literature [cf. @melcuk1993; @wunderlich1993; @wunderlich2015; @dixon2000a; @dixon2014; @haspelmath2004c; @kulikov2011; @malchukov2015: 96ff.; @zuniga2019]. Although I have been using these terms as if their meaning is clear, this is often far from the case. Many different terms and definitions have been proposed in the literature, and different terms have at times been used for the same phenomena. For example, the original proposal for the term 'antipassive' is already 50 years old [@silverstein1972: 395], but the same phenomenon is also known as deaccusative [@geniusiene1987: 94] or antiapplicative [@haspelmath2004c: 1132; @scheibl2006: 371]. Reversely, antipassive is also attested referring to a slightly different phenomenon of the drop of an object [@scheibl2006: 372-373]. 

In this section I will describe in more detail how these names are used and defined in the current book about German diatheses. The names for diatheses will here always refer to a macrorole pattern, i.e. to the highly abstract classification of a diathesis in terms of ~~SBJ~~, ~~OBJ~~, etc. as defined in [@sec:intro-remapping]. For example, the term 'anticausative' will be used as a name for the macrorole pattern ~~[OBJ › SBJ › Ø]~~. Such macrorole patterns are strictly defined here in a language-specific way for German, so care should be taken when applying the same names to different languages.

One widespread term that I will avoid is the term 'middle' (and likewise the Latinate equivalent term 'medium'). This term for a diathesis is already attested as *μεσότης* in the oldest known Greek grammatical text, the *τέχνη γραμματική* of Dionysius Thrax, and it has become a mainstay in the grammatical literature ever since.^[Thrax writes: *διαθέσεις εἰσὶ τρεῖς, ἐνέργεια, πάθος, μεσότης* "there are three diatheses, active, passive and middle" [@uhlig1883: 48].] The phenomena that are called 'middle' in the literature are highly variable, and there is no consensus about what kind of diathesis this term is supposed to designate, other than something that is neither active nor passive [see @zuniga2019: 168-177 for a thorough summary of the complex philological history of the term middle/medium]. Such a broad and ill-defined term is not useful for a detailed analysis of the large variety of attested role-remappings in German.

The discussion about the different names for macrorole patterns will be split into four parts. First, the next two sections will present names for diatheses involving the nominative subject. Subsequent sections will discuss diatheses not involving the subject. In both discussions, a central distinction will be made between isolated diatheses and chained diatheses (cf. [@sec:intro-chaining]).

### Isolated subject diatheses {#sec:intro-isolated-subject-diathesis}

{#par:verbative} Isolated diatheses that involve a nominative subject are not widespread in German. The most widespread kind is the drop of the subject ~~[SBJ › Ø]~~, i.e. the complete removal of the role marked as nominative subject without any further accompanying role-remapping or reintroduction of a new subject. This is typically attested with intransitive verbs: after removing the single available role, there is no other role introduced to fill the structural subject position. Semantically, such diatheses put the focus on the activity as described by the verb itself, so I propose to call them ~~verbative~~ diatheses.^[Unfortunately, there is another use of the term *Verbativ* in the German grammatical tradition, which originates in the work of Engel [e.g. @engel1996: 198, 251, 347]. Engel's concept is completely different from my concept here. We just happened to stumble upon the same neologism.] Note that there is a strong tendency for every German sentence to formally have a nominative subject with verb agreement. Consequently, such verbative diatheses almost always result in the presence of a valency-simulating nominative pronoun *es* (see [@sec:intro-es]). 

A ~~verbative~~ diathesis is attested with verbs like *stinken* 'to stink' [@next], see [@sec:case-nominative-drop]. In a sentence like *es stinkt* the pronoun *es* can of course simply be an anaphor, like in [@next b]. In such a sentence, the role of 'stinker' is still present and there is no diathesis at all. However, in other contexts [@next c] the verb *stinken* is used without implied subject. This is typically attested in contexts in which some odour is attested, but the originator is not known.

::: ex
~~Verbative [SBJ › Ø]~~

a. Der Müll stinkt.
b. Das schmutzige Tuch, es stinkt!
c. Hier stinkt es.
:::

Another example of a verbative diathesis is illustrated with the verb *leben* 'to live' [@next], see [@sec:adverbial-reflexive-drop]. Many such intransitive verbs can be used without a subject in a habitual sense, but this is only possible with an obligatory adverbial qualification like *gut* [@next b,c].

::: ex
~~Verbative [SBJ › Ø]~~

a. Ich lebe in diesem Haus.
b. In diesem Haus lebt es sich gut.
c. ^* In diesem Haus lebt es sich.
:::

Also the so-called impersonal passive consisting of *werden+Partizip* [@next], see [@sec:participles-werden-impersonal-passive], is an example of a verbative diathesis, in this case even without any valency-simulating *es*.

::: ex
~~Verbative [SBJ › Ø]~~

a. Die Jungs tanzen hier.
b. Hier wird getanzt.
c. ^* Hier wird es getanzt.
:::

{#par:demotive} A different kind of isolated subject diathesis is subject demotion of the nominative subject to a prepositional phrase. An example is the *geben+zu‑Infinitiv* [@next], see [@sec:zuinfinitive-geben-demotion]. In this diathesis, the subject is demoted to an optional non-governed prepositional phrase ~~[SBJ › ADJ]~~. The demotion is the only role-remapping that is happening in this diathesis, so I propose to call such a diathesis a ~~Demotive~~.

::: ex
~~Demotive [SBJ › ADJ]~~

a. Wir gewinnen einen Preis. 
b. es gibt (für uns) einen Preis zu gewinnen.
:::

The other isolated subject diatheses are only attested in incidental examples in German, like a subject demotion to a governed preposition ~~[SBJ › PBJ]~~ with *fehlen* shown in [@next], see [@sec:prepositions-nominative-demotion].

::: ex
~~Demotive [SBJ › PBJ]~~

a. Das Geld fehlt ihm.
b. Ihm fehlt es an Geld.
:::

Isolated ~~subject addition [Ø › SBJ]~~ is very rare in German, partly because it would need an unmarked construction without any subject to start off with. A possible example is the addition of a subject that seems possible with some weather verbs like *donnern* 'to thunder' [@next], see [@sec:case-nominative-addition].

::: ex
~~Subject addition [Ø › SBJ]~~

a. Es donnert. 
b. Die Motoren donnerten.
:::

### Chained subject diatheses

Chained diatheses that involve the nominative subject are widespread in German (in contrast to the infrequent occurrence of isolated diatheses as discussed previously). [@fig:subjectchains] presents an overview of the different terms that I will use for these diatheses. The bold-faced terms are used for widely attested diatheses, while the other kinds of diatheses are only incidentally found. There is currently no evidence in German for the existence of the remappings that are left empty in the figure. There appears to be a preference for various kinds of demotion (i.e. the upper right corner of the figure), which fits nicely with the known typological preference of German for anticausative constructions [@haspelmath1993a: 101; @nichols2004: 189].

![Names for chained macro-role remappings involving the subject](figures/subjectchains){#fig:subjectchains}

The upper right triangle of [@fig:subjectchains] are demotions, the lower left triangle are promotions, and the diagonal are examples of symmetrical diatheses. I will discuss all types in this order.

#### Demotions {#sec:intro-subject-demotions}

{#par:anticausative} The most extreme kind of demotion is an ~~anticausative [OBJ › SBJ › Ø]~~. The typical characteristic of an anticausative is the complete removal of the nominative subject that is the causer of the action/state of the clause. Filling the syntactic gap, a case-marked argument (typically the accusative) is promoted to subject. This is a widespread kind of diathesis. An example is the reflexive anticausative with verb like *schliessen* 'to close' [@next], see [@sec:reflexive-anticausative].

::: ex
~~Anticausative [OBJ › SBJ › Ø]~~

a. Ich schließe die Tür.
b. Die Tür schließt sich (von alleine). 
:::

{#par:passive} Very similar to an anticausative is the ~~passive [OBJ › SBJ › ADJ]~~. The main difference between the two (a distinction which is often difficult to delimit) is that for a passive the original subject is still implied and can optionally be overtly expressed [@next]. In contrast, for an anticausative the original subject is completely removed and a phrase like *by itself* can typically be added. As an example of a passive diathesis in [@next] is the *bekommen Rezipientenpassiv* in which a dative is promoted to subject [@sec:participles-bekommen-passive]

::: ex
~~Passive [OBJ › SBJ › ADJ]~~

a. Ihr Freund kocht ihr eine Suppe.
b. Sie bekommt von ihrem Freund eine Suppe gekocht.
:::

{#par:conversive} A ~~conversive [OBJ › SBJ › PBJ]~~ looks similar to a passive, except that the prepositional phrase is a lexically governed preposition, so it has a more object-like grammatical status. An example is the verb *empören* 'to appall' [@next a] with the reflexive diathesis *sich empören über* 'to be outraged about' [@next b,c], see [@sec:reflexive-preposition-passive]. The term conversive is adapted from Kulikov [-@kulikov2011: 380].

::: ex
~~Conversive [OBJ › SBJ › PBJ]~~

a. Der Preis empört den Kunden.
b. Der Kunde empört sich über den Preis.
c. Der Kunde empört sich darüber, dass der Preis schon wieder gestiegen ist.
:::

{#par:fabricative} For the next diathesis, I propose the term ~~fabricative [PBJ › SBJ › Ø]~~ based on Lat. *fabrica* 'plan, trick, workmanship'. This term is used for a diathesis in German in which a fabricated product can be expressed either as a governed prepositional phrase or as a nominative subject. This diathesis occurs for example with various verbs of emotional interactions like *überraschen* 'to surprise' [@next a], see [@sec:prepositions-fabricative-accusative]. To understand this diathesis, a distinction is needed between the role of the 'fabricator' (here: *Lehrer*, 'teacher') and the role of the 'fabricated product', which induces the emotion (here: *Aufgabe*, 'assignment'). The *mit* prepositional phrase that expresses the fabricated product in [@next a] is a governed preposition [@next c]. The diathesis promotes this fabricated product to nominative subject and the fabricator is removed from the expression [@next b]. The experiencer in the accusative *mich* remains unchanged.

::: ex
~~Fabricative [PBJ › SBJ › Ø]~~

a. Der Lehrer überrascht mich mit seiner Aufgabe.
b. Die Aufgabe überrascht mich.
c. Der Lehrer überrascht mich damit, dass er die Aufgabe schon korrigiert hat.
:::

{#par:conciliative} A similar kind of diathesis is called here a ~~conciliative [ADJ › SBJ › Ø]~~ based on Lat. *conciliator* 'intermediary, mediator'. In a conciliative an external object (typically an instrument) is promoted to subject [@next], see [@sec:prepositions-transitive-conciliative]. The conciliative and fabricative in German both regularly use a prepositional phrase with *mit*, but the grammatical status is clearly different. The *mit* phrase in a conciliative is an optional adjunct [@next], while the *mit* phrase in a fabricative is a governed preposition [@last]. This grammatical difference is paralleled by a functional difference in the role that is promoted to subject: a conciliative concerns a (typically tangible) instrument that is used by an agent, while a fabricative promotes a (typically intangible) creation that is produced by the agent.

::: ex
~~Conciliative [ADJ › SBJ › Ø]~~

a. Der Doktor heilt die Wunde mit einer Salbe.
b. Die Salbe heilt die Wunde.
:::

#### Promotions {#sec:intro-subject-promotions}

{#par:novative} The most widespread promotion to subject attested in German is the diathesis with role-remapping ~~[Ø › SBJ › OBJ]~~, called ~~novative~~ here (based on Lat. *novare* 'renew, refresh, change'). This role-remapping is best known as 'causative', but this semantic characterisation does not hold for all examples of this diathesis. Various other novative diatheses exist in which the new nominative is not a causer but an experiencer, opionator or a permission giver. 

Semantically, the most widespread kind of novative adds a new causer to the construction, like with the diatheses between *brennen* 'to burn (intransitive)' and *verbrennen* 'to burn (transitive)' [@next], see [@sec:preverb-causative]. Such a diathesis is aptly called a ~~causative~~.

::: ex
~~Causative novative [Ø › SBJ › OBJ]~~

a. Der Tisch brennt.
b. Ich verbrenne den Tisch.
:::

{#par:experientive} The *sehen+Infinitiv* diathesis [@next], see [@sec:infinitive-sehen], adds a new nominative subject and the old nominative is turned into an accusative. This diathesis is thus structurally an example of a novative ~~[Ø › SBJ › OBJ]~~. However, the newly added nominative is not a causer. The new role is better described as an experiencer, so this diathesis can semantically be called an ~~experientive~~. Similar constructions are also attested with light-verbs *hören*, *fühlen*, and *spüren*.

::: ex
~~Experientive novative [Ø › SBJ › OBJ]~~

a. Der Junge putzt den Tisch.
b. Ich sehe den Jungen den Tisch putzen.
:::

{#par:opiniative} The *finden+Partizip* diathesis [@next], see [@sec:participles-finden-opinionator] also adds a new nominative subject while the old nominative is turned into an accusative. The role of the new nominative is best characterised as somebody having an opinion, so this diathesis can semantically be called an ~~opiniative~~. The main verb is typically a patientive intransitive predicate like *scheitern*, 'to fail', see [@sec:participles-restrictions]. Similar constructions also exist with light verbs *wissen*, *sehen* and *glauben*.

::: ex
~~Opiniative novative [Ø › SBJ › OBJ]~~

a. Das Projekt scheitert.
b. Ich finde das Projekt gescheitert.
:::

The *lassen+Infinitiv* diathesis [@next], see [@sec:infinitive-lassen-causative] is also structurally a novative ~~[Ø › SBJ › OBJ]~~. This diathesis has multiple possible interpretations, among them also a causative reading [@next]. However, in the example in [@nnext] the newly added nominative is allowing the action to happen, not causing it, so this diathesis can semantically be called a ~~permissive~~. This second interpretation typically happens with agentive intransitive predicates like *schlafen* 'to sleep', see [@sec:participles-restrictions]. However, note that in both examples the other interpretation is also possible, albeit only is specially crafted contexts. 

::: ex
~~Causative novative [Ø › SBJ › OBJ]~~

a. Der Junge schläft ein.
b. Ich lasse den Jungen einschlafen. \
   (= Ich sorge dafür, dass der Junge einschläft.)

:::

::: ex
~~Permissive novative [Ø › SBJ › OBJ]~~

a. Der Junge schläft.
b. Ich lasse den Jungen schlafen. \
   (= Ich erlaube, dass der Junge weiter schläft.)
:::

Finally, the *lehren/helfen+Infinitiv* diathesis [@next], see [@sec:infinitive-lehren], is a novative in which the role of the new subject is more of an assistant than a real causative. Therefor it is called here an ~~assistive~~ novative. Note that both *lehren* and *helfen* can also be used with *zu‑Infinitiv*, but then the constructions are not coherent, so those constructions are not included among the diatheses.

::: ex
~~Assistive novative [Ø › SBJ › OBJ]~~

a. Der Sohn faltet die Wäsche.
b. Der Vater lehrt seinem Sohn die Wäsche falten.
:::

{#par:novativedemotion} The ~~novative with extended demotion [Ø › SBJ › PBJ]~~ is extremely rare in German. The name is adapted from Kulikov [-@kulikov2011: 388] to denote a diathesis in which the demotion accompanying the novative is not just ~~[SBJ › OBJ]~~ but ~~[SBJ › PBJ]~~. The diathesis between *freuen* 'to be pleased' and *erfreuen* 'to please' [@next] might be an example because *mit* is a governed preposition [@next c], see [@sec:preverb-reversed-fabricative].

::: ex
~~Novative with extended demotion [Ø › SBJ › PBJ]~~

a. Das Geschenk freut mich.
b. Er erfreut mich mit einem Geschenk.
c. Er erfreut mich damit, dass er mich besucht.
:::

Slightly more widespread, a ~~novative with extreme demotion [Ø › SBJ › ADJ]~~ is a novative diathesis that almost completely removes the erstwhile subject. This is attested in an interesting group of constructions using light verbs like *finden* with a participle and a transitive main verb like *aufheben* 'to preserve' [@next], see [@sec:participle-finden-transitive-opiniative]. With this diathesis, there is a new opiniator introduced, just like with the opiniative above (see [@par:opiniative]). However, the erstwhile nominative subject is now demoted to an optional prepositional phrase.

::: ex
~~Novative with extreme demotion [Ø › SBJ › ADJ]~~

a. Das Archiv hebt den Nachlass auf.
b. Ich finde den Nachlass (im Archiv) gut aufgehoben.
:::

The remaining types of promotions are rare. A ~~reversed passive [ADJ › SBJ › OBJ]~~ demotes the subject to object and at the same time promotes a new subject from an erstwhile adjunct role. An example in German is the diathesis from *erben* 'to inherit' to *enterben* 'to disinherit' [@next a,b], see [@sec:preverb-inverted-passive-accusative-loss]. This is semantically very close to a causative ~~[Ø › SBJ › OBJ]~~, in which the newly introduced causer can sometimes be expressed as an adjunct [@next c,d]. This affinity between a reversed passive and a causative is reminiscent of the affinity between a passive and an anticausative. In both pairs, the difference amounts to a switch between the closely related macro-role of an optional adjunct ~~(ADJ)~~ and being completely unexpressed ~~(Ø)~~.

::: ex
~~Reversed passive [ADJ › SBJ › OBJ]~~

a. Ich erbe den Schreibtisch von meinem Vater.
b. Mein Vater enterbt mich.
c. Der Wettkampf endet (durch den Gong).
d. Der Gong beendet den Wettkampf.
:::

Finally, a ~~reversed conversive [PBJ › SBJ › OBJ]~~ differs from a reversed passive in that the prepositional phrase is a lexically governed preposition, as can be identified by a possible  *da+preposition, dass…* paraphrase. This is for example attested for the diatheses between *staunen über* 'to marvel' and *erstaunen* 'to amaze' [@next], see [@sec:preverb-inverted-passives].

::: ex
~~Reversed conversive [PBJ › SBJ › OBJ]~~

a. Ich staune über deine Arbeit.
b. Deine Arbeit erstaunt mich.
c. Ich staune darüber, dass du schon fertig bist.
:::

#### Symmetrical subject diatheses {#sec:intro-symmetrical-subject}

{#par:inversive} Completely symmetrical diatheses involving the subject are rare in German. A perfectly symmetrical ~~inversive [OBJ › SBJ › OBJ]~~ is a diathesis that switches subject and object. This term is proposed by Malchukov [-@malchukov2015: 99-100] in reminiscence of the so-called 'inverse' marking found in Algonquian languages. An inversive diathesis is designated as a "symmetric conversive" by Kulikov [-@kulikov2011: 380]. An example of an inversive is the diathesis between *wundern* 'to puzzle' and *bewundern* 'to admire' [@next], see [@sec:preverb-accusative-inversive].

::: ex
~~Inversive [OBJ › SBJ › OBJ]~~

a. Dein Verhalten wundert mich.
b. Ich bewundere dein Verhalten.
:::

Much more widespread in German are diatheses in which a nominative/accusative construction is inverted into a dative/nominative construction. This is for example attested for the *bleiben+zu‑Infinitiv* diathesis [@next], see [@sec:zuinfinitive-bleiben]. Because dative and accusative are both classified here as ~~OBJ~~, this counts as an inversive diathesis. However, when a separation between core (accusative) and non-core (dative/genitive) case would be pursued (see [@par:corecase]), then this diathesis would be an example of demotion. There are two remappings, namely down from ~~SBJ~~ to ~~non-core-OBJ~~ and up from ~~core-OBJ~~ to ~~SBJ~~. When non-core is taken as being lower on the macrorole hierarchy [@ex:macrorolehierarchy] then the biggest jump is the jump down, which is the definition of demotion (see [@sec:intro-remapping]). Instead of adding a completely new set of categories I propose to simply split ~~inversive~~ into two subtypes and call this phenomenon ~~demoted inversive~~. 

::: ex
~~Demoted inversive [OBJ › SBJ › OBJ]~~

a. Ich räume den letzten Schrank ein.
b. Dieser letzte Schrank bleibt mir noch einzuräumen.
:::

The opposite ~~promoted inversive~~ promotes a dative/genitive into a nominative subject, and demotes the erstwhile nominative to an accusative. This is illustrated with the *haben+Infinitiv* diathesis in [@next], see [@sec:infinitive-haben].

::: ex
~~Promoted inversive [OBJ › SBJ › OBJ]~~

a. Ein Tropfen hängt ihm an der Nase.
b. Er hat einen Tropfen an der Nase hängen.
:::

At the other extreme, a ~~commutative [Ø › SBJ › Ø]~~ completely removes the old subject and introduces a completely new role as subject. I propose this term on the basis of Lat. *commutare* 'exchange, replace'. A German example of such a diathesis is the *geben+Partizip* construction [@next], see [@sec:participles-geben-commutative]

::: ex
~~Commutative [Ø › SBJ › Ø]~~

a. Irgendjemand verliert den Ring.
b. Ich gebe den Ring verloren.
:::

The two other symmetrical diatheses in between the two extremes are even rarer. A ~~preposition inversive [PBJ › SBJ › PBJ]~~ is similar to an inversive, but the exchange is with a governed preposition. This is arguably attested in the diathesis between *strahlen* 'to shine' and *erstrahlen* 'to gleam' [@next], see [@sec:preverb-location-inversive].

::: ex
~~Preposition inversive [PBJ › SBJ › PBJ]~~

a. Die Sonne strahlt auf das Haus.
b. Das Haus erstrahlt in der Sonne.
:::

Finally, an example of an ~~adjunct commutative [ADJ › SBJ › ADJ]~~ is possibly attested with the verb *wimmeln* 'to swarm' [@next], see [@sec:prepositions-subject-switch].

::: ex
~~Adjunct commutative [ADJ › SBJ › ADJ]~~

a. Die Kinder wimmeln auf den Platz.
b. Der Platz wimmelt von Kindern. 
:::

### Isolated object diatheses

The situation with object diatheses is reversed from the previously discussed subject diatheses. With object diatheses, isolated diatheses are much more widespread and they occur with a wide variety of role-remappings, see [@fig:objectdiatheses]. In contrast, chained diatheses are less widespread and can mostly be analysed as a combination of multiple isolated diatheses.

The top right diatheses in [@fig:objectdiatheses] are demotions, while the bottom left ones are promotions.
The bottom right is completely empty because these remappings are not diatheses anymore, but simply optional marking. There is a strong tendency for object demotions to be either unmarked or marked by reflexive pronouns in German, while the object promotions are typically marked by preverbs or obligatory adverbs. The exception to this generalisation are the so-called locative and delocative diatheses. With those, promotions (locatives) are formally unmarked, while demotions (delocatives) are marked by preverbs or obligatory adverbs. I have currently no explanation for this rather clear markedness pattern.

![Names for isolated remappings without involvement of the subject](figures/objectdiatheses){#fig:objectdiatheses}

I will discuss the different role-remappings from [@fig:objectdiatheses] in four subsections. First, I will look at the various kinds of applicatives and antipassives (mid left and mid top), then at the objectives and deobjectives (top right and left bottom), followed by locative and delocative diatheses (mid bottom and mid right), and finally at the symmetrical exchanges (on the diagonal).

#### Applicatives & antipassives {#sec:intro-applicative-antipassive}

Applicatives and antipassives are very similar, though reversed. ~~applicatives [ADJ › OBJ]~~ change a prepositional phrase into a case-marked phrase, while ~~antipassives [OBJ › ADJ]~~ convert a case-marked phrase into a prepositional phrase. Given this affinity, instead of 'antipassive' it might be better to call such remappings 'antiapplicative' [e.g. @haspelmath2004c: 1132] or 'deapplicative' (in line with the other names below).

By removing or adding an object, applicatives and antipassives regularly change the transitivity of the sentence. However, because case marking in German is nominative/accusative aligned, changes in transitivity are not reflected in the marking of the subject. This is crucially different from languages with ergatively aligned case marking, in which antipassives also include a change in the marking of the subject, namely from ergative to absolutive. Terminologically, these two situations might be distinguished by using the term 'deapplicative' for nominative/accusative languages and reserve 'antipassive' for ergative/absolutive languages. I decided against that distinction and the term 'antipassive' will be used throughout in this book with this explicit caveat.

Applicatives occur frequently with the addition of a preverb, like in the alternation between *steigen auf* 'to climb' and *besteigen* 'to mount' [@next], see [@sec:preverb-applicative].

::: ex
~~Applicative [ADJ › OBJ]~~

a. Sie steigt auf den Berg.
b. Sie besteigt den Berg.
:::

Antipassives in German are often unmarked (see further below), but an example of an antipassive with a clear markedness direction is the alternation between *treffen* 'to meet' and reflexive *sich treffen mit* 'to meet with [@next], see [@sec:reflexive-mit-antipassive].

::: ex
~~Antipassive [OBJ › ADJ]~~

a. Ich treffe dich.
b. Ich treffe mich mit dir.
:::

The object of applicatives and antipassives is typically an accusative, but datives can also be targeted. An example of a dative applicative is the alternation between *stammen aus* 'to hail from' and *entstammen* 'to be descended from' [@next], see [@sec:preverb-dative-applicative]. An example of a dative antipassive is the covert alternation of *berichten* 'to report' [@nnext], see  [@sec:prepositions-dative-antipassive-accusative].

::: ex
~~Dative applicative [ADJ › OBJ]~~

a. Ich stamme aus einem Adelsgeschlecht.
b. Ich entstamme einem Adelsgeschlecht
:::

::: ex
~~Dative antipassive [OBJ › ADJ]~~

a. Er berichtet dem Vorstand alles.
b. Er berichtet alles an den Vorstand.
:::

In the discussion of diatheses in this book I consistently distinguish ~~governed applicatives [PBJ › OBJ]~~ and ~~governed antipassives [OBJ › PBJ]~~ when the prepositional phrase is a governed preposition. An example of a governed applicative is the diathesis between *arbeiten an* 'to work on' (with a governed preposition *an*) and *bearbeiten* 'to edit, adapt' [@next], see [@sec:preverb-governed-applicative]. An example of a governed antipassive is the diathesis between *beklagen* 'to lament' and *sich beklagen* 'to complain' (with a governed preposition *über*) [@nnext], see [@sec:reflexive-accusative-antipassive]. However, the differentiation between the governed and non-governed applicative/antipassive does not currently allow for any promising semantic or structural generalisations, so this differentiation might grammatically be unnecessary.

::: ex
~~Governed applicative [PBJ › OBJ]~~ 

a. Ich arbeite an dem Text. \
   Ich arbeite daran, dass der Text fertig wird.
b. Ich bearbeite den Text.
:::

::: ex
~~Governed antipassives [OBJ › PBJ]~~

a. Ich beklage den Lärm. \
   Ich beklage mich über den Lärm.
b. Ich beklage mich darüber, dass es so laut ist.
:::

There are a many diatheses with a role-remapping between adjunct and object that do not have any overt indication of a direction. Without explicit marking it is difficult to decide whether such diatheses are cases of (applicative) promotion ~~[ADJ › OBJ]~~ or (antipassive) demotion ~~[OBJ › ADJ]~~. For the sake of organisation in this book I classify such covert alternations on the basis of (debatable) semantic intuitions.

Most covert diatheses with an alternation between prepositional phrases and case-marked arguments are classified here as ~~antipassive~~, like in the alternation between *schießen auf* 'to aim at' and *schießen* 'to shoot' [@next], see [@sec:prepositions-accusative-antipassive]. This is also widespread with datives [@nnext], see [@sec:prepositions-dative-antipassive-accusative]. In such examples, I judge the case-marking to be more basic than the prepositional phrase. 

::: ex
~~Covert antipassive [OBJ › ADJ]~~

a. Ich schieße den Bären.
b. Ich schieße auf den Bären.
:::

::: ex
~~Covert dative antipassive [OBJ › ADJ]~~

a. Ich schreibe dir einen Brief. \
b. Ich schreibe einen Brief an dich.
:::

In contrast, there is a widespread alternation between datives and *für* prepositional phrases [@next] that I classify as an ~~applicative~~, see [@sec:prepositions-benefactive-dative]. In this example the dative seems to be the derived construction.

::: ex
~~Covert applicative (benefactor raising) [ADJ › OBJ]~~

a. Er kocht eine Suppe für mich.
b. Er kocht mir eine Suppe.
:::

{#par:possraising} There is a further kind of covert diathesis with a dative object, conventionally called ~~possessor raising~~. In such diatheses there is an alternation between a possessor (typically expressed as an adnominal genitive) and a dative [@next]. The dative can alternate with the possessor of a nominative subject (see [@sec:case-possessor-of-nominative-to-dative-experiencer]), an accusative object (see [@sec:case-possessor-accusative-to-dative]) or a location (see [@sec:prepositions-possessor-of-location-to-dative-experiencer]). Following widespread convention, I classify these diatheses as promotion ~~[ADJ › OBJ]~~

::: ex
~~Covert applicative (possessor raising) [ADJ › OBJ]~~

a. Er schneidet meine Haare.
b. Er schneidet mir die Haare.
:::

These two covert kinds of dative applicative (viz. benefactor and possessor applicative) are semantically and structurally clearly distinct. The datives that show a possessive alternation [@last] are semantically experiencers. In contrast, datives that alternate with *für* prepositional phrases [@llast] are semantically benefactors. In especially crafted context it is possible to evoke either reading for the same sentence, [@next].

::: ex
a. ^^?^ Ich schneide dir (zuliebe) in den (meinen) Finger. \
    (= Ich schneide für dich in meinen Finger.)
b. Ich schneide dir in den (deinen) Finger. \
    (= Ich schneide in deinen Finger.)
:::

#### Objectives & deobjectives {#sec:intro-objective-deobjective}

A ~~deobjective diathesis [OBJ › Ø]~~ is a diathesis that drops an object, i.e. a role cannot be expressed anymore [the term is taken from @haspelmath2004c: 1131]. A deobjective drop is illustrated in [@next] with an alternation from *kaufen* 'to buy' to *einkaufen* 'to shop', see [@sec:preverb-accusative-drop] for an extensive discussion.

::: ex
~~Deobjective [OBJ › Ø]~~

a. Ich habe gestern ein Buch gekauft.
b. Ich habe gestern eingekauft.
:::

A special variant of a deobjective occurs with verbs that apply to the body, like *verbrennen* 'to burn' [@next]. In such constructions, a reflexive pronoun is necessary. This diathesis is called ~~endoreflexive~~ [@haspelmath1987: 27-28], see [@sec:reflexive-accusative-drop] for an extensive discussion.

::: ex
~~Deobjective (endoreflexive) [OBJ › Ø]~~

a. Er verbrennt das Buch.
b. Er verbrennt sich.
:::

{#par:objective} An ~~objective diathesis [Ø › OBJ]~~ is a diathesis that adds a new object, i.e. a completely new role is introduced in the form of an object. An example of an overtly marked object addition is the alternation from *zaubern* 'to perform magic' to  *verzaubern* 'to enchant' [@next]. Additions are frequently attested with preverbs like *ver-*, see [@sec:preverb-accusative-addition].

::: ex
~~Objective [Ø › OBJ]~~

a. Sie zaubert.
b. Sie verzaubert mich.
:::

A semantically special subgroup of object additions are ~~resultatives~~. A resultative diathesis adds an object that is the result of performing the activity described by the predicate.^[Confusingly, the term "resultative" is also used in the literature with an aspectual meaning, namely to indicate a special kind of state induced as the result of performing the predicate [e.g. @nedjalkov1988a].] An overtly marked resultative is illustrated in [@next] with the diathesis between *arbeiten* 'to work' and the inherent reflexive *sich etwas erarbeiten* 'to acquire something through work', see [@sec:preverb-reflexive-resultative]. The result of the work is added as an object in [@next b].

::: ex
~~Objective (resultative) [Ø › OBJ]~~

a. Ich arbeite.
b. Ich erarbeite mir ein Vermögen. \
   (= Ich arbeite, und das Resultat ist, dass ich ich ein Vermögen besitze.)
:::

Objectives and deobjectives are frequently attested without any overt marking (cf. ambitransitive/labile verbs), and in such 'covert' diatheses it is difficult to establish a direction. As already noted in the previous section, for the sake of organisation in this book I classify such covert alternations on the basis of (often debatable) semantic intuitions. For example, the verb *stören* 'to disturb' [@next] can be used both with and without an accusative object, see [@sec:case-accusative-drop]. This is classified here as a deobjective diathesis. Such unmarked object drops are also attested with datives, see [@sec:case-dative-drop], and with governed prepositions, see [@sec:prepositions-demotion-of-object]. The dropping of an object is also often possible to put the focus on the action itself, but then it is typically used with an adverbial, see [@sec:adverbial-action-focus] for an extensive discussion.

::: ex
~~Covert deobjective [OBJ › Ø]~~

a. Du störst die Veranstaltung.
b. Du störst.
:::

In contrast, the verb *stottern* 'to stutter' is classified here as an example of object addition [@next], although there is no formal differentiation from the previous example with object drop [@last]. The intuition is that *stottern* is basically intransitive (and any object is thus added), while *stören* is basically transitive (and any missing object is thus dropped). Correlated with this proposed difference is the fact that covert object addition with *stottern* has a resultative interpretation [@next b]. However, it remains to be seen whether there is really a difference between these two kinds of verbs (see [@sec:case-accusative-addition] for an extensive discussion).

::: ex
~~Covert objective (resultative) [Ø › OBJ]~~

a. Er stotterte.
b. Er stotterte eine Entschuldigung. \
   (= Er stotterte, und das Resultat ist eine Entschuldigung.)
:::

#### Locatives & delocatives {#sec:intro-locative-delocative}

A ~~Locative diathesis [Ø › PBJ]~~ is a diatheses that adds an obligatory locational phrase ~~PBJ~~ to the clause.^[There is no connection between a locative diathesis and a locative case. Both terms simply use the word *locative* to describe the fact that the marking of location is concerned.]  For example, the transitive *befehlen* 'to order' marks the ordered person as an accusative [@next a]. With an (directional) locative phrase *an die Front* 'to the frontline' the sentence gets a caused-motion or resultative reading [@next b], see [@sec:prepositions-transitive-location-as-result].

::: ex
~~Locative (caused motion) [Ø › PBJ]~~

a. Ich befehle eine Armee.
b. Ich befehle die Armee an die Front. \
   (= Ich befehle, und dadurch geht die Armee an die Front.)
:::

Even more noteworthy, such a caused-motion diathesis is also possible with many intransitive verbs like *schwitzen* 'to sweat' [@next a]. With such verbs, a locative diathesis not only adds a location, like *in mein Hemd* 'in my shirt', but also an resultative accusative object, like *einen Fleck* 'a stain' [@next b], see [@sec:prepositions-intransitive-location-as-result].

::: ex
~~Locative (caused motion) [Ø › PBJ, Ø › OBJ]~~

a. Ich schwitze.
b. Ich schwitze einen Fleck in mein Hemd. \
   (= Ich schwitze, und dadurch ist ein Fleck in meinem Hemd.)
:::

{#par:delocative} The reversal of a locative diathesis is a ~~delocative diathesis [PBJ › Ø]~~. In such a diathesis an obligatory location loses its obligatory status. An example of such a diathesis is shown in [@next] with the alternation between *stecken* 'to put into' and *verstecken* 'to hide'. The verb *stecken* needs an obligatory location [@next a,b]. Such an obligatory location is classified here as a prepositional object ~~PBJ~~ (see [@sec:intro-arguments-utterance-valency]). The situation is different with the verb *verstecken*. With this verb the location is an optional adjunct and can be left out (see [@sec:preverb-transitive-antiresultative] for an extensive discussion).

b. ^* Ich stecke das Geschenk.
c. Ich verstecke das Geschenk in dem Schrank.
d. Ich verstecke das Geschenk.
:::

#### Symmetrical object diatheses {#sec:intro-symmetrical-object}

Symmetrical object diatheses are rare in German. A ~~case change [OBJ › OBJ]~~ is illustrated in [@next] by the alternation between *folgen* 'to follow' (with dative) and *verfolgen* 'to chase' (with accusative), see [@sec:preverb-dative-accusative].

::: ex
~~Case change [OBJ › OBJ]~~

a. Ich folge dem Auto.
b. Ich verfolge das Auto.
:::

A ~~governed preposition change [PBJ › PBJ]~~ does occur in German, but such diatheses have not been explicitly collected in this book. Possible examples are *arbeiten an* 'to work on' [@next a] changing into *sich durcharbeiten* 'to work through' [@next b] or *sorgen für* 'take care of' [@next c] changing into *sich sorgen um* 'to worry about' [@next d].

::: ex
~~Governed preposition change [PBJ › PBJ]~~

a. Er arbeitet an den Daten. 
b. Er arbeitet sich durch die Daten.
c. Er sorgt für seine Mutter.
d. Er sorgt sich um seine Mutter.
:::

An ~~adjunct change [ADJ › ADJ]~~ is, according to the definitions, not a diathesis at all, as adjuncts are not lexically specific. However, the change between a possessor *dein* 'your' [@next a] and a non-governed prepositional phrase *von dir* 'from you' [@next b] can be seen as as a borderline examples, see [@sec:prepositions-possessor-to-preposition].

### Chained object diatheses {#sec:intro-object-chains}

Chains of object diatheses (i.e. chains with the object in the middle of the chain) can always be interpreted as a combination of two isolated ('single') object diatheses from the previous section. However, not all theoretically possible combinations are attested (see [@fig:objectchains]). The most frequently attested diatheses are the highlighted ~~object exchange~~ diatheses ([@sec:intro-object-exchange]). A few incidental examples of ~~chained case change~~ are also attested ([@sec:intro-chained-case-change]).

![Attested chains of object diathesis](figures/objectchains2){#fig:objectchains}

#### Object exchange {#sec:intro-object-exchange}

The highlighted diatheses in the center and bottom-right of the figure are the most frequent object chains, called collectively ~~object exchange~~. Most of these diatheses are used with verbs that involve some kind of part/whole relations between objects. Additionally, these diatheses have a strong resultative component in that the new object is the affected result of the action. A typical example is the diathesis between *schmieren* and *beschmieren* 'to smear, to spread' [@next], see [@sec:preverb-applicative-antipassive]. In such examples a prepositional phrase (*auf*) turns into a new accusative, while the old accusative is turned into a prepositional phrase (*mit*). So, syntactically the accusative object is exchanged from *Salbe* to *Wunde*. Semantically, the *Wunde* is the 'whole' to which the 'part' *Salbe* is applied.

::: ex
~~Object exchange~~

a. Ich schmiere die Salbe auf die Wunde.
b. Ich beschmiere die Wunde mit der Salbe.
:::

Different variants of object exchange show an astonishingly strong correlation between syntactic pattern and semantic interpretation. Basically, promotions have the effect that the new object is a part of the old object (i.e. the new object is a ~~meronym~~), while demotions have the reverse effect, i.e. the new object encompasses the old object (i.e. the new object is a ~~holonym~~). To appreciate this generalisation is important to recall how demotions and promotions are defined for chained diatheses (cf. [@sec:intro-remapping]). This definition is not trivial because chained diatheses are always a combination of both a promotion and a demotion. So the question is which of the two 'wins'. 

An object exchange is a combinations of a promotion (objective ~~[Ø › OBJ]~~, applicative ~~[ADJ › OBJ]~~ or locative ~~[PBJ › OBJ]~~) and a demotion (deobjective ~~[OBJ › Ø]~~, antipassive ~~[OBJ › ADJ]~~ or delocative ~~[OBJ › PBJ]~~). By definition, a chained diathesis is deemed to be a demotion when the demotion-part is stronger than the promotion-part, and vice versa. This strength is measured as the size of the 'jump' on the ~~macrorole hierarchy~~, repeated here in [@next]. Different kinds of chained demotions can even be compared: the stronger the difference in 'jump size', the more extreme the demotion (likewise with promotions). This whole concept of chained demotions/promotions can be visualised by considering the top-right to bottom-left diagonal in [@fig:objectchains]. The top-right corner ~~[OBJ › OBJ › Ø]~~ is the most extreme demotion and the bottom-left corner ~~[Ø › OBJ › OBJ]~~ is the most extreme promotion. All other possibilities are in between on this diagonal.

::: ex
Macrorole Hierarchy

~~SBJ » OBJ » PBJ » ADJ » Ø~~
:::

For example, consider again the diathesis from *schmieren* to *beschmieren* [@next]. It consist of a promotion from a prepositional phrase *auf die Wunde* to an accusative *die Wunde* and a demotion from an accusative *die Salbe* to a prepositional phrase *mit der Salbe*. The promotion starts from an obligatory location, i.e. this is a locative diathesis ~~[PBJ › OBJ]~~. In contrast, the demotion ends in an optional instrumental phrase, i.e. this is an antipassive diathesis ~~[OBJ › ADJ]~~. Now, an antipassive demotion ('two steps down') is a bigger jump on the macrorole hierarchy than a locative promotion ('one step up'), so the whole object exchange ~~[PBJ › OBJ › ADJ]~~ is classified as a demotion. According to the above mentioned generalisation, this demotion coincides with the fact that the new object *Wunde* is the holonym to which the old object *Salbe* is applied.

::: ex
~~Object exchange with demotion [PBJ › OBJ › ADJ]~~

a. Ich schmiere die Salbe auf die Wunde.
b. ^* Ich schmiere die Salbe.
c. Ich beschmiere die Wunde mit Salbe.
d. Ich beschmiere die Wunde.
:::

As used here, the terms 'meronym/holonym' have to be interpreted as a language-specific classification of the German language. Not all examples necessarily correspond to a (universal) semantic conceptualisation of these terms. For example, German verbs the describe some kind of covering (e.g. *schmieren* 'to smear') or wrapping (e.g. *wickeln* 'to wrap around') consistently mark the cover/wrapping as the meronym and the covered/wrapped object as the holonym.

#### Demoted object exchange

There are two different kinds of object exchange with demotion, namely the ~~filled holonym~~ and the ~~emptied holonym~~ object exchange. These two kinds of object exchange correlate with the intensity of the demotion. A minor demotion manifests a full-holonym object exchange, while a more extreme form of demotion expresses an empty-holonym object exchange. 

Typically, a ~~filled holonym~~ diathesis is expressed with a ~~[PBJ › OBJ › ADJ]~~ remapping chain, as illustrated above with *schmieren/beschmieren* in [@last]. Note that in that example, the post-diathesis holonym *Wunde* is 'filled with' the pre-diathesis meronym *Salbe*. With other examples, like *pflanzen/bepflanzen* 'to plant' [@next] the holonym *Garten* 'garden' is more literally filled with the meronym *Tulpen* 'tulips'. However, different from [@last] in this example the pre-diathesis location *in den Garten* is not obligatory [@next a,b]. This is the kind of minor syntactic variation that is indicated in [@fig:objectchains] with the unnamed boxes in the centre of the object exchange domain. Such examples appear to be a minority though (cf. [@sec:preverb-applicative-antipassive]).

::: ex
~~Object exchange (filled holonym) [ADJ › OBJ › ADJ]~~

- Ich pflanze Tulpen in den Garten.
- Ich pflanze Tulpen.
- Ich bepflanze den Garten mit Tulpen.
- Ich bepflanze den Garten.
:::

The reverse kind of holonym is the ~~emptied holonym~~ diathesis, expressed with the more extreme ~~[PBJ › OBJ › Ø]~~ remapping chain. This is illustrated in [@next] with the diathesis between the verb *klopfen* and *ausklopfen* 'to pound', see [@sec:preverb-location-antiresultative]. In [@next a] the verb *klopfen* takes an accusative object that expressed the result of the pounding (*Staub* 'dust'). The pounded object (*Mantel* 'coat') is expressed as an obligatory location phrase [@next b]. Crucially, the accusative object in this original construction is always a component part (meronym) of the locational object (holonym). The diathesis from *klopfen* to *ausklopfen* [@next c] completely drops the meronym (*Staub* 'dust') from the sentence ~~[OBJ › Ø]~~ and promotes the holonym (*Mantel* 'coat') to accusative ~~[PBJ › OBJ]~~. The erstwhile meronymic accusative cannot be expressed anymore [@next d]. Semantically, the new accusative object *Mantel* is 'emptied' from its old accusative object *Staub*, so the new accusative object after this diathesis is an 'emptied holonym'. 

::: ex
~~Object exchange (emptied holonym) [PBJ › OBJ › Ø]~~

a. Ich klopfe den Staub von meinem Mantel.
b. ^* Ich klopfe den Staub.
c. Ich klopfe meinen Mantel aus.
d. ^* Ich klopfe meinen Mantel von den Staub aus.
:::

#### Promoted object exchange

With promotion, there are also two different kinds of object exchange, namely the ~~joined meronym~~ and the ~~parted meronym~~ object exchange. These two kinds of object exchange correlate with the intensity of the promotion. A minor promotion manifests a joined-meronym object exchange, while a more extreme form of promotion expresses a parted-meronym object exchange. Basically, these diatheses are reversals of the two holonymic object exchanges discussed previously.

The ~~joined meronym~~ object exchange occurs with less extreme demotions. For example, with the diathesis from *nähen* 'to sew' [@next a] to *festnähen* 'to fixate by sewing' [@next b] the original object, *Bluse* 'blouse', turns into an optional *an* prepositional phrase [@next c]. This part of the chain is an antipassive diathesis ~~[OBJ › ADJ]~~. At the same time a new object is introduced, *Knopf* 'button'. This object could not have been expressed before. That part of the chain is an objective diathesis ~~[Ø › OBJ]~~. This objective promotion is a larger step than the antipassive demotion, so the whole diathesis is a promotion. Semantically, the new object (*Knopf*) is a meronymic part of the erstwhile holonymic object (*Bluse*). Also, the new object is connected to the old object. In summary, the new object is a 'joined meronym'.

::: ex
~~Object exchange (joined meronym) [Ø › OBJ › ADJ]~~

- Ich habe eine Bluse genäht.
- Ich habe den Knopf an die Bluse festgenäht.
- Ich habe den Knopf festgenäht.
:::

In some examples the joined-meronym object exchange allows for optional prepositional phrases at both sides of the diathesis, for example with the diathesis from *massieren* 'to massage' [@next a,b] to *einmassieren* 'to massage in' [@next c,d]. Semantically, the new accusative object (*Öl*, 'oil') is a meronym of the old object (*Muskeln* 'muscles'), and the new object is applied to the old object to become a part of it. In summary, the new object is a 'joined meronym'.

::: ex
~~Object exchange (parted meronym) [ADJ › OBJ › ADJ]~~

a. Ich habe die Muskeln mit Öl massiert.
b. Ich habe die Muskeln massiert.
c. Ich habe das Öl in die Muskeln einmassiert.
d. Ich habe das Öl einmassiert.
:::

The ~~parted meronym~~ object exchange occurs with more extreme promotions. For example, the verb *waschen* 'to wash' normally takes an accusative object that is the 'washee', here *Hose* 'trousers' [@next a]. There is a covert diathesis that introduces a new object that could not be expressed earlier, here *Fleck* 'stain' [@next b]. That is an objective promotion ~~[Ø › OBJ]~~. At the same time, the original accusative is turned into a prepositional phrase and this prepositional phrase cannot be left out [@next c], i.e. an antipassive demotion ~~[OBJ › PBJ]~~. The combination is an extreme promotion ('three steps up, one step down'). Semantically, the new object *Fleck* is a part of the original object *Hose* and it is removed from it. In summary, the new object is a 'parted meronym'

::: ex
~~Object exchange (free meronym) [Ø › OBJ › PBJ]~~

a. Ich wasche meine Hose.
b. Ich wasche den Fleck aus meiner Hose. 
c. ^* Ich wasche den Fleck.
:::

#### Other kinds of object exchange

There are a few other examples of object exchange that do not fit in the general pattern described above, for example with *zwingen/erzwingen* 'to force' [@next a,b], see [@sec:preverb-applicative-von-antipassive]. This chained diathesis is a remapping of the form ~~[PBJ › OBJ › ADJ]~~ because the preposition *zu* is a governed preposition (and not an obligatory location as in the demotions discussed previously).

::: ex
~~Object exchange (persuasion) [PBJ › OBJ › ADJ]~~

a. Er zwingt ihn zu einem Geständnis.
b. Er zwingt ihn dazu, ein Geständnis abzulegen.
c. Er erzwingt ein Geständnis (von ihm).
:::

Another special case of an object exchange is illustrated here with the verb *bewundern* 'to admire' [@next], see [@sec:prepositions-possessor-to-preposition]. This verb (and others like it) show a combination of a possessor-raising applicative ~~[ADJ › OBJ]~~ and a governed antipassive ~~[OBJ › PBJ]~~ leading to the object exchange ~~[ADJ › OBJ › PBJ]~~.

::: ex
~~Raised possessor+governed antipassive [ADJ › OBJ › PBJ]~~

a. Ich bewundere seine Ehrlichkeit.
b. Ich bewundere ihn für seine Ehrlichkeit.
c. Ich bewundere ihn dafür, dass er ehrlich ist.
:::

#### Chained case changes {#sec:intro-chained-case-change}

Finally, there are a few object chains involving a change of case, shown at the top and the left of [@fig:objectchains]. Note that a case change of dative/genitive to accusative can be interpreted as a promotion (and the reverse as a demotion, cf. [@par:corecase]), but that perspective will not be followed here. 

Example [@next] shows a combination of a dative-to-accusative case change with an antipassive, resulting in a chain ~~[OBJ › OBJ › ADJ]~~. The verb *schenken* 'to gift' takes a recipient in the dative and a patient in the accusative, while the derived *beschenken* 'to gift' turns the accusative into a prepositional phrase (i.e. antipassive) and changes the dative *dir* into an accusative *dich* (see [@sec:preverb-antipassive-dative-accusative]).

::: ex
~~Antipassive+case change [OBJ › OBJ › ADJ]~~

a. Ich schenke dir ein Buch.
b. Ich beschenke dich mit einem Buch.
:::

The reverse situation, i.e. a chain ~~[ADJ › OBJ › OBJ]~~, is attested with the diathesis between *drängen* 'to urge' and the derived *aufdrängen* 'to impose' [@next], see [@sec:preverb-applicative-accusative-to-dative]. In this example a prepositional phrase changes into an accusative (i.e. applicative), while the accusative *dich* changes to dative *dir*.

::: ex
~~Applicative+case change [ADJ › OBJ › OBJ]~~

a. Ich dränge dich zu einem Abo.
b. Ich dränge dir ein Abo auf.
:::

Finally, an idiosyncratic diathesis is attested with the verb *rauben* 'to rob' [@next], see [@sec:preverb-dative-accusative-genitive]. When this verb is changed to *berauben* 'to rob' then two case changes happen simultaneously: first a dative-to-accusative change (*dich* becomes *dir*) and second an accusative-to-genitive change (*das Buch* becomes *des Buches*). This is thus an example of a remapping pattern ~~[OBJ › OBJ › OBJ]~~. However, note that the chain dative-to-accusative-to-genitive suggests a combination of promotion and demotion, alike to other object exchanges.

::: ex
~~Double case change [OBJ › OBJ › OBJ]~~

a. Ich raube dir das Buch.
b. Ich beraube dich des Buches.
:::
