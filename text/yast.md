# The YAST approach

## Why YAST

Do we really need Yet Another Syntax Theory™ (YAST)? Time will have to tell. In essence, YAST is an experiment build on a single fundamental question, namely what a syntax theory would look like when monoclausal derivation ('stacking') is strictly separated from biclausal subordination.

The motivation to propose such a syntax theory for an already well-described language like German grew out of a large research project on German diathesis (Cysouw 2022). That book proposes a long list of all monoclausal syntactic derivations for German. That list is long (currently more than 300 clause derivations, and counting), but clearly finite. Now, the impetus for YAST was the simple idea to investigate what remains to be done for a syntactic theory once all these clause derivations are put aside. In other words, how does a syntactic theory look like when monoclausal derivations are reduced to just check boxes to be ticked, alike to treating other finite categories like tense or number somewhere in the syntax tree. YAST is the result of following that premise through.

## YAST in a nutshell

# Rules for predication

## Clause (*Satz*)

## Predication setup (*Prädikation*)

Basically a verb with lexical arguments. A PHRASE leads to *Prädikatives Substantiv*
Lexical arguments can be filled with either PHRASE or SATZ (*Komplementsatz*)

## Predication derivation (*Ableitung*)

Epitheses and diatheses

## Predication modification (*Adverbial*)

Either a PHRASE or SATZ (*Adverbialsatz*)
also: adverbs, negation, particles, adjectives+gradation

## Predication format (*Satzart*)

*Hauptsatz*, *nicht-finite Nebensätze*, *Nominalisation*, usw.
also: add characteristic *Finit* to the verb

# Rules for reference

## Phrase (*Phrase*)

## Reference setup (*Referenz*)

Determination (quantification+article+numeral) and phrasal head
If SATZ then *Nominalisation*

## Reference modification (*Attribut*)

either PHRASE (*Präpositionalphrase*) or SATZ (*Relativsatz*)
also: adjectives+gradation

# Finishing up

## Lexical insertion

## Government and agreement

## Flexible word order

# Reducing YAST

## YAST to constituent structure

## YAST to dependency structure

## YAST to basic school grammar

## YAST to advanced school grammar
