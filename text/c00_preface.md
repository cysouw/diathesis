# Preface {.unnumbered}

To start off I would like to offer a major disclaimer: this book is a work in progress. The current version undoubtedly contains numerous errors, omissions, inaccuracies and wrong generalisations. I can say this with certainty because I have been changing, adding and deleting details up to the publication of the current version of this book. And I do not expect it to stop here. Actually, the work-in-progress status is intended to be taken quite literally: I plan to update and revise this book regularly in the future. Any progress can be followed online at <https://github.com/cysouw/diathesis>. I welcome any suggestions for improvement, which can be submitted as an 'issue' on that website, or, even better, as a 'pull request' including proposed changes and corrections.

This book is about German grammar, but the book is written in English. These two decisions have a purely personal background. First, the idea to write about German grammar arose in the context of me teaching German grammar at the Philipps-University in Marburg. Actually, the diversity of diathesis could, and should, be investigated in depth in any language besides German. Second, the book is written in English first and foremost because I personally feel more comfortable writing in English than in German. Also, I think that my approach to diathesis is also of interest to readers that do not care to much about the details of German grammar. For the readers that are interested in those details of German, I assume that they both have a working knowledge of English (so they can read this text) and of German (so they can understand the German examples). For that reason I decided to omit any interlinear glossing of the examples. Most examples are simple enough to be understood even with just an approximate understanding of German. Adding interlinear glossing throughout would be an enormous undertaking, which I think is not worthwhile given the intended readership.

Of the many students that have participated in my lectures and seminars (and had to endure my work-in-progress) I would like to explicitly thank Dennis Beitel, Franziska Beyer, Patricia Bier, Katja Daube, Milena Gropp, Eric Ilten, Jens Jakob, Christina Jann, Vanessa Lang, Katrin Leinweber, Rieke HÃ¤nche, Philip Ossowski, Nico Reinicke, Kristina Splanemann, and Stella van den Berg. They wrote very useful term-papers or theses about topics related to the topics discussed here.
