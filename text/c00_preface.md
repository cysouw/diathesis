### Preface {.unnumbered}

Errors and omission are unavoidable in scientific writing: errors are words that should not have been written, while omissions are words not said that should have been. If you will, these are the writer's equivalents of statistical Type I and Type II errors, respectively. And just as with statistical data, I have worked hard to keep all errors and omission to a minimum in relation to the number of justified statements and judgements.

Still, I need to start with a major disclaimer: this book is a work in progress. The current version undoubtedly contains numerous errors, omissions, inaccuracies and wrong generalisations. I can say this with certainty because I have been changing, adding and deleting details up to the last moment before publication of the current version of this book. And I do not expect it to stop here. Actually, the work-in-progress status is intended to be taken quite literally: I plan to update and revise this book regularly in the future. Any progress can be followed online at <https://github.com/cysouw/diathesis>. I welcome any suggestions for improvement, which can be submitted as an 'issue' on that website, or, even better, as a 'pull request' including proposed changes and corrections.

This book is about German grammar, but the book is written in English. These two decisions have a purely personal background. First, the idea to write about German grammar arose in the context of me teaching German grammar at the Philipps-University in Marburg. Actually, the diversity of diathesis could, and should, be investigated in the same depth in other language besides German. Second, the book is written in English first and foremost because I personally feel more comfortable writing in English than in German. Also, I think that the current approach to diathesis is also of interest to readers that do not care too much about all minute details of German grammar. And for the readers that are interested in those details of the German language, I assume that they both have a working knowledge of English (so they can read this text) and of German (so they can understand the German examples). For that reason I decided to omit any interlinear glossing of the examples. Most examples are simple enough to be understood even with just an approximate understanding of German. Adding interlinear glossing throughout would be an enormous undertaking, which I think is not worthwhile given the intended readership.

Technically, this book is written in Pandoc Markdown. [Markdown](https://commonmark.org) allows for clean and readable raw text, while [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org) provides easy transformations of the text into beautiful output formats like Latex/PDF, HTML and EPUB. I have used various extensions for Pandoc ('filters' in Pandoc-parlance), for example to include [linguistic examples](http://github.com/cysouw/pandoc-ling). More information on these filters can be found on the github-webpage mentioned above. 

The many lists, examples and subsections of this book make it almost a serialised database, and I have included many cross-references to connect related parts throughout. To read the resulting hypertext I would urge the reader to try and read an electronic version, either PDF or HTML. I personally have become really enamoured with the HTML version as it allows for quick forward-and-backward jumping through the text using our already internalised muscle-memory from web-browsing. Also, the advances in CSS-styling are progressed to such an extend that the layout of HTML is almost approaching LateX levels, while adding responsive/adaptive design possibilities [@marcotte2010]. The HTML version of this book is prepared as a single standalone file that can be used offline, it just uses the webbrowser as a text-rendering engine. The file size of the HTML version is even smaller than the PDF prepared with XeLateX.

Of the many students that have participated in my lectures and seminars (and had to endure my work-in-progress) I would like to explicitly thank Dennis Beitel, Franziska Beyer, Patricia Bier, Katja Daube, Milena Gropp, Eric Ilten, Jens Jakob, Christina Jann, Vanessa Lang, Katrin Leinweber, Rieke HÃ¤nche, Philip Ossowski, Nico Reinicke, Kristina Splanemann and Stella van den Berg. They wrote very useful term papers or theses about topics related to the topics discussed here.
